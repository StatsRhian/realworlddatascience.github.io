Get ready to engage with Real World Data Science as we unveil an exciting editorial refresh! We're thrilled to announce that submissions are now open across our four dynamic sections: The Pulse, Applied Insights, Foundations & Frontiers, and People & Pathways. Join us as we redefine the conversation in data science with fresh perspectives and insights.
Real World Data Science is relaunching to meet the pace and complexity of today's data-driven world in real time, with the RSS's trademark steadying presence. We will be publishing high-quality case-studies, tutorials and think-pieces that bridge the gap between rigorous analysis and real-time relevance, and that speak directly to latest events and emerging trends. 

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by members of the Real World Data Science [Editorial Board](https://realworlddatascience.net/the-pulse/editors-blog/posts/2022/10/18/meet-the-team.html).  

## Our Audience:  
People working in data science looking for practical insights, methodological rigour and thought-leadership that informs their work and decision-making. 

## Our Voice:  
Authoritative, Trustworthy, Cutting Edge 

## Our Editorial Sections:  
Real World Data Science has four editorial sections. Please read through and consider where your piece would fit best. Each piece we publish needs to be tailored towards the focus of one of these sections.  

[THE PULSE](https://realworlddatascience.net/the-pulse/)

## Use of AI in Submissions  
We recognise that LLMs and other generative AI tools are increasingly part of the data science workflow, from code generation and data cleaning to drafting documentation and shaping analysis. We welcome a transparent approach in submissions that have made use of these tools, and ask that authors include a declaration outlining where and how AI was used in the development of their submission. This helps us maintain transparency, uphold standards of reproducibility, and better understand the evolving role of AI in real-world data science practice. 

To make your submission, please review our [contributor guidelines](https://realworlddatascience.net/contributor-docs/contributor-guidelines.html) and email us at rwds@rss.org.uk
