Welcome to the home of **Real World Data Science**, a new project from the [Royal Statistical Society](https://rss.org.uk/), in partnership with the [American Statistical Association](https://www.amstat.org/). This site and its content are being developed by data science practitioners and leaders with a single goal in mind: to help you deliver high quality, ethical, impactful data science in your workplace.

[Meet the team](the-pulse/editors-blog/posts/2022/10/18/meet-the-team.qmd)

## What are our aims?
As the field of data science evolves rapidly - with new tools, controversies, and breakthroughs emerging almost daily - Real World Data Science offers a space for timely, thoughtful responses grounded in the expertise of our contributors and reviewed by a distinguished editorial board.
We want to serve people working in data science who are looking for practical insights, methodological rigour and thought-leadership that informs their work and decision-making.
We want to help you:  
* discover and learn more efficiently;  
* acquire practical problem-solving skills;  
* share your knowledge and accomplishments publicly;  
* work smarter, ethically, and more effectively.  

## What we provide
Commentary, case studies, interviews, and explainers that speak directly to latest events and emerging trends. 
Whether unpacking the implications of a new technological development or product launch, or spotlighting innovative practice in the field, the platform is practical, credible and unafraid to ask the hard questions.
