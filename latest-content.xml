  <title>Generative AI models and the quest for human-level artificial intelligence</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have taken the world by storm over the past year. The human-like outputs of these systems, and the recent publication of a guideline to determine the degree of consciousness of machines, have again raised the question of whether machines will soon be able to replicate human intelligence. In this article, we discuss some of the merits and limitations of modern machine learning models, and also provide a general view of human intelligence and the position of “intelligent” systems in the constellation of human capabilities.</p>
<p>Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are designed to process and understand natural language, and to generate human-like text in response to prompts and questions. This is achieved thanks to a specific type of deep learning architecture called the <em>Transformer</em>, which consists of an encoder and a decoder, each made up of some number <em>N</em> of blocks. Here the input text is eventually transformed into predicted (and contextualised) output text (Figure&nbsp;1).<sup>1</sup> LLMs are trained on complex and large bodies of text so that they can learn complex patterns and relationships between words in sentences, in different contexts.</p>

<p>The two main types of LLMs are autoregressive models and autoencoding models. Autoregressive models such as OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) generate text by predicting the next word in a sequence given the previously emitted words. Autoencoding models such as Google’s BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) also aim to produce coherent and contextually relevant text, but they do so by attempting to predict missing words (from a corrupted version of the text) while considering the surrounding context.</p>
<p>LLMs are engineering marvels capable of producing syntactically flawless, coherent, and remarkable responses to complex requests such as question answering, text summarisation, computer code generation, document classification, text generation and sentiment analysis. We tend to associate linguistic skills with intelligence because communication via an elaborate language system is largely synonymous with the human intellect. So, do the linguistic skills of tools like ChatGPT mean these systems are close to displaying human-level intelligence? Proponents of the Turing test might well argue “yes”. Most would still say “no”.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="speaking-and-understanding">Speaking and understanding</h2>
<p>The Turing test was proposed by Alan Turing in the 1950s. It operates on the basis that if a person is unable to tell whether the entity they are interacting with over typed messages is a human or a machine (irrespective of the answers being correct), the machine is said to have achieved human-level intelligence.<sup>2</sup> There’s some debate over whether ChatGPT could pass this test; it has been specifically trained not to impersonate humans and will frequently preface its responses with the phrase, “As a large language model…”, thus giving the game away. But <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/editors-blog/posts/2023/01/27/talking-chatgpt.html">others are impressed at what developers like OpenAI have been able to achieve</a> in terms of building artificial models that can sustain realistic-sounding conversations.</p>
<p>This, though, is where the Turing test falls apart as a means of assessing machine intelligence. The ability to “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02361-7">mimic human chatter</a>” does not by itself suggest that a machine understands what it is ‘reading’ or ‘writing’ in the same way a human would. Consider a different set of tests, called the Winograd schemas – puzzles that differ by one or two words and whose solutions cannot be determined using statistics but instead require common sense and an understanding of the physical world.<sup>3</sup> For example, the following sentence:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The trophy would not fit in the suitcase because it was too <strong>small/large</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Humans would infer that if the last word of that sentence is <em>small</em>, then <em>suitcase</em> is the object being described, whereas if the word is <em>large</em> then we are referring to the <em>trophy</em>. ChatGPT v3.5 was unable to make this inference when the question was first put to it (see Figure&nbsp;2), although a later test finds it now can – as can other LLMs. Some suggest that this type of improvement comes from training ChatGPT to do better on some of the tasks that are routinely used to highlight model limitations on social media at the expense of <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/chatgpt-quality-worsened/492145/">giving worse answers in other contexts</a>. But could this improvement be due to ChatGPT and other models suddenly having acquired common sense and an understanding of the physical world? A more complex set of Winograd schema questions, the WinoGrande dataset, suggests not: humans still outperform computers on these tests.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>Machines will likely beat us all at these puzzles one day, in the same way that they already beat the world champions of chess and Go, can translate across multiple languages, and diagnose rare forms of cancer that escape well-trained doctors. These <em>narrow AI</em> applications that spectacularly outperform humans at very specific tasks will become more and more common. But will a multiplicity of narrow AI soon lead to general AI that can compete or beat humans at <em>all</em> tasks? Will human-level linguistic capabilities inevitably result in machines acquiring human-level intelligence in the not-too-distant future? Some developers and researchers certainly believe or hope so. Others remain sceptical.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thinking-and-learning">Thinking and learning</h2>
<p>What is “intelligence”, anyway? More than 70 working definitions currently exist.<sup>5</sup> One that focuses specifically on human-level intelligence while excluding lower types of animal intelligence is this: “intelligence can be understood as the ability to generate a range of plausible scenarios about how the world around you may unfold and then base sensible actions on those predictions”.<sup>6</sup> Does this come anywhere close to describing the way LLMs work, or indeed any other machine learning algorithm?</p>
<p>In my view, part of the reason why attaining human-level intelligence remains a distant goal has to do with how machines think differently from us.</p>
<p>The goal of a machine learning algorithm is always to optimise a particular function – whether the machine is playing chess (the goal is to win) or classifying images (the goal is to correctly classify as many images as possible). The majority of problems that human intelligence has to “solve”, however, do not always have a clear goal. Consider a simple chatbot standing in for a human on a customer helpline: What scalar quantity should it look to optimise? Is it ensuring that engagement with the customer is informative and supportive? Or, perhaps the goal is to build a recurrent relationship. In either case, how will these quantities be measured? Dealing with this type of real-world problem, where the variable to optimise is not well-defined, represents a formidable obstacle for the development of machine learning algorithms whose behaviour must approximate human intelligence.</p>
<p>Moreover, machines can be surprisingly easy to fool. For example, placing an object next to the one we are trying to classify can confuse image classification algorithms – a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1sp4X57TL4">well-known example shows a patch being placed next to a banana</a>, which makes the deep neural network (DNN) classify the banana as a toaster with a high degree of confidence. We can also fool image classification networks <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11553">by showing the same object under different lighting conditions and orientations</a>, such as when we flip a school bus on its side (as in an accident). The reason why a DNN cannot do this trivial mental rotation is because learning algorithms cannot generalise knowledge to unseen (or “out of distribution”) examples – imbuing them with no small amount of “brittleness”.<sup>7</sup> Compare this to the human mind, which learns in a semi-supervised manner: we need only be shown a few guiding examples to be able to extrapolate knowledge. This is a clear evolutionary adaptation since most real-world learning is semi-supervised: we do not need to explore every road to learn to drive, nor do every possible differentiation exercise to become confident at calculus. Likewise, we do not need to become fully bilingual in a language before we start combining newly learned words to try to explain complex concepts.</p>
<p>Next to GPT-4’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774">100-trillion parameter model</a>, the human brain seems <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/">much more</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165">parsimonious</a>. Therefore, progress in AI would perhaps come faster if we could teach machines to learn from a few (or no) labelled examples instead of being so heavily dependent on terabytes of labelled data (supervised learning) and on our own interpretation of the world.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>Another major limitation of algorithms for achieving human-like adaptive learning in changing environments is the fact that they cannot keep learning without forgetting previously learned training data. This phenomenon is called <em>catastrophic forgetting</em>,<sup>9</sup> and it occurs because of the <em>stability-plasticity dilemma</em>: this states that a certain degree of plasticity is required for the integration of new knowledge, but also radically new knowledge (e.g.&nbsp;large weight changes in a DNN) disrupts the stability necessary for retaining the previously learned representations (Figure&nbsp;3). In other words, weight stability is synonymous with knowledge retention, but it also introduces the rigidity that prevents the learning of new tasks.<sup>10</sup></p>

<p>Although some ingenious approaches have been developed for mitigating catastrophic forgetting (and which are much smarter than simply building a new network for each new task), it has also been shown that no single method can solve catastrophic forgetting while allowing incremental learning in every possible situation.<sup>11</sup> The problem with catastrophic forgetting is not only that it contradicts a fundamental characteristic of human intelligence – the ability to learn within, and adapt to, changing environments;<sup>12</sup> catastrophic forgetting is also a major bottleneck for the development of adaptable systems that learn incrementally from the constant flow of data in the real world, such as autonomous vehicles, recommender systems, anomaly detection methods and, in general, any device embedded with sensors. Moreover, the development of continual learning methods is key not just for machine intelligence, but also for learning scalability: by 2025 the world will be <a href="https://www.seagate.com/files/www-content/our-story/trends/files/idc-seagate-dataage-whitepaper.pdf">producing some 175 zettabytes of data annually</a>, of which we will only be able to <a href="https://www.uber.com/en-GB/blog/uber-big-data-platform/">store between 3% and 12%</a>. Thus, for learning to be scalable in the future, continual learning methods will need to be able to process data faster and in real time, learn on the fly and then discard the data, much like humans do.</p>

<section id="how-are-we-wired" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-are-we-wired">How are we wired?</h2>
<p>One further bottleneck for machines emulating human-level intelligence is that we do not yet understand the circuitry of the brain well enough to be able to reproduce it, and therefore we have been working with misleading models. For instance, the realisation of the “all-or-nothing” nature of action potentials (i.e.&nbsp;there is no such thing as the partial firing of a neuron) led McCulloch and Pitts to propose the concept of the artificial neuron and suggest that networks of neurons could equally be modelled as (all-or-nothing) logical propositions.<sup>13</sup> From this point onwards, the dominant idea over most of the past century has been that the brain is essentially a computer. But even on a superficial level of analysis, brains and computers have very different architectures and behaviour, with computers specifically making optimal use of virtually unlimited memory as well as an extraordinary capacity for brute-force searching. On the microscopic level, networks of neurons cannot possibly be modelled as logical propositions because they do not really operate in this manner: a single neuronal synapse is an environment that harbours hundreds of proteins that specifically interact with other proteins in complex networks that possess clear time-space coordinates. Neurons process information and generate not just electrical signals but also discrete biochemical changes that occur in cycles instead of linearly. Moreover, a system like the brain responds to stimuli over long periods of time, which can effect changes in its own behaviour. Understanding at least how some cognitive tasks are performed at an algorithmic level would likely translate into major progress towards emulating human-level intelligence.<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>GPT-4’s impressive capabilities can make people believe that some AI systems are conscious on a human level (since animals display limited consciousness), but this is an illusion. Consciousness is another essential quality that we can easily recognise when we see it, but which (like intelligence) is extraordinarily difficult to define – other than consciousness simply being everything you experience, or, more formally put, the “awareness of internal and external existence”.<sup>15</sup> Could machines eventually achieve consciousness? This is a controversial and key question because, besides intelligence, having a degree of consciousness on the level exercised by humans is believed to be necessary for displaying goal-directed behaviour.<sup>16</sup> Recall that machine learning algorithms do have the general goal of optimising functions but these goals are determined by human programmers, not the machines themselves.</p>
<p>A fundamental question regarding the development of consciousness is this: if an AI system were close to consciousness, how would we know? Butlin and colleagues recently explored the question in a groundbreaking paper where they compiled a list of “indicator properties” drawn from various neuroscientific theories of consciousness (since no theory is clearly superior). The idea is that the more boxes an AI system ticks, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08708.pdf">the more likely it is close to being conscious</a>. The authors argue that a failure to identify artificial consciousness has important moral implications because an entity that exhibits consciousness invariably influences how we feel it should be treated. While this is likely true, humans do not necessarily need to feel that an entity is conscious in order to develop empathy. Emotional attachment is a basic human instinct, and we have a tendency to anthropomorphise. You may remember the story of hitchBOT, a clearly unconscious yet friendly robot invented by David Smith of McMaster University. <a href="https://twitter.com/hitchbot">HitchBOT</a> could barely speak and its only mission was to autostop. It ended up travelling throughout Europe and North America thanks to the sympathy it generated. The “beheading” of the robot in Philadelphia in 2015 had huge repercussions across the planet because thousands of strangers had developed empathy and become <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/americans-murder-friendly-canadian-hitchhiking-robot">emotionally attached to hitchBOT</a> despite never having met it.<sup>17</sup> Do you think that a machine is likely to develop a degree of human-like empathy anytime soon?</p>
<p>Finally, another fundamental human trait that is absent from machines, and which is particularly important in these trying times, is our capacity for remaining <em>hopeful</em>, which can be seen as a post-hoc rationalisation of our survival instinct. Being hopeful means that we think things will improve beyond what would be reasonable to predict for the immediate or medium-term future given the most recently available data points. Jane Goodall defines hope as “a crucial survival trait that enables us to keep going in the face of adversity”. Desmond Tutu gave an equally ethereal definition: “Hope is being able to see that there is light despite all the darkness”.<sup>18</sup> One fundamental aspect of hope is its undeniable association with <em>agency</em>, i.e.&nbsp;our capacity to <em>voluntarily</em> act in a given environment: even when we are at odds with the desired outcome, hope makes us take action, which in turn fuels more hope, thus establishing a dynamic form of self-stimulation over thousands of ethical actions without necessarily having a clear variable to optimise, which machines are incapable of doing. And, one very interesting thing about hope is that its effects can be quantified in the short term: hope is much better than intelligence and personality at predicting academic performance,<sup>19</sup> as well as performance in the workplace, with hopeful workers being reported as 14% more productive.<sup>20</sup></p>

<section id="closing-thoughts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>Generative language-based models have reignited much interest in the possibility of artificially recreating human-level intelligence. Despite being seminal breakthroughs, we must not forget that LLMs are, essentially, just very sophisticated pattern recognition systems which, when trained on even larger datasets, may become even better at predicting the most appropriate responses to different prompts. LLMs are incomplete models of thought, though, plagued by practical problems that we have not discussed here, such as giving incorrect answers, security breaches, privacy concerns regarding personal data used in their training datasets, algorithmic opacity and an inability to meet the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and their amplification of web <em>bias</em> which can result in answers that discriminate against different groups.<sup>21</sup> Even if these limitations are fixed one day, the capabilities of LLMs still do not approximate general human intelligence.</p>
<p>Generative models are just one type of narrow AI application. Such applications will continue to evolve at a very fast pace and produce breakthroughs of paramount importance. Some of the latest breakthroughs in the biomedical field include the discovery of new antibiotics against deadly antibiotic-resistant bacteria<sup>22</sup> and <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphafold-using-ai-for-scientific-discovery-2020/">AlphaFold’s</a> accurate prediction of a protein’s structure from its amino acid sequence.<sup>23</sup> <sup>24</sup> The number of ways an amino acid sequence may fold is astronomical. Thus being able to predict a protein’s structure as accurately as experimental measurements (by X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy) represents a gigantic step towards understanding a protein’s likely function and its regulation, how it may be drugged to combat diseases and for antibiotic development, and its manipulation to guide vaccine design as was done during the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.10.443524v1">coronavirus pandemic</a>.<sup>25</sup> Most impressively, AlphaFold is able to predict the structural effects of single amino changes (mutations), which is essential for engineering new proteins as well as for understanding evolutionary history and mechanistic aspects of diseases.<sup>26</sup></p>
<p>Being able to harness the power of narrow AI applications and delegate some tasks to machines will allow humans to focus on those tasks at which we do better than machines. <em>Augmented intelligence</em> is the name given to the close collaboration between humans and machines, which was first proposed in the 1950s, and is now <a href="https://pz.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/Intelligence%20Augmentation-%20Upskilling%20Humans%20to%20Complement%20AI.pdf">finally within reach</a>.<sup>27</sup> <sup>28</sup> Current examples of devices that are a functional extension of human beings are virtual reality headsets that expand the users’ senses and perceptions, implantable technologies that substitute access cards, and, in general, any software that automates research and data analysis. Since such technological developments might make us more “intelligent” or at least more productive, will we then still need machines that display human-like intelligence?</p>
<p>The official position of some major players like Microsoft is to not even attempt to replicate human intelligence but to produce “AI centred on assisting human productivity in a responsible way”.<sup>29</sup> Still, a recent paper that reported GPT-4’s impressive performance at solving a number of difficult tasks (in the fields of mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law and psychology) suggests that GPT-4 displays “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712">sparks of artificial general intelligence</a>”. This is in line with OpenAI’s <a href="https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond">clearly stated goal</a> of developing human-level intelligence. However, the debate over whether we are getting any closer to replicating intelligence with just a few impressive generative models that simply recombine and duplicate data on which they have been trained is self-limiting because it takes a very narrow view of human intelligence. For one thing, mindlessly generating text (“speaking”) and thinking are <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-emily-m-bender.html">two very different things</a>. It has been shown that while LLMs may excel at formal linguistic competence (understanding language rules and patterns), their performance on tasks that evaluate human thought in the real world (functional linguistic competence) is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06627">very limited</a>. Moreover, GPT-4 is unable to reason. We can define reasoning as the process of drawing justifiable conclusions from a set of premises, which is also a key component of intelligence. When given a set of 21 distinct problems ranging from simple arithmetic and logic puzzles to spatial and temporal reasoning, and medical common sense, <a href="https://medium.com/@konstantine_45825/gpt-4-cant-reason-2eab795e2523">GPT-4 proved incapable of applying elementary reasoning techniques</a>.</p>
<p>OpenAI’s newest headline-grabbing development, <a href="https://openai.com/sora">Sora</a>, shares many of the limitations of GPT-4. Sora is a model that can generate video clips from text prompts – but while it may prove useful for content creation, it seems incapable of understanding the real world. OpenAI’s defence is that Sora still struggles with “simulating the physics of a complex scene” but that it “represents a foundation for models that can understand and simulate the real world”. This is, OpenAI believes, key for training models that will help solve problems that require simulating the physical world (e.g.&nbsp;rescue missions), and eventually for achieving general AI. However, it is suspected that Sora’s limitations in understanding the physical world have nothing to do with physics. For example, in <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1758249750909096142?s=61">a generated video of a monkey playing chess in a park</a>, we see a 7x7 board and three kings. This is likely not an error of insufficient training data or of computational power. This is an error that reveals a failure to discern the cultural regularity of the world by making wrong generalisations despite having ample evidence of the existence of universal 8x8 chess boards and one king per player. A video of <a href="https://twitter.com/openai/status/1758192965703647443?s=61">a stylish woman wandering in Tokyo</a> is also incorrect for the same reason: nobody takes two consecutive left steps in a row (about 30s into the video). Sora also does not appear to understand cause and effect; for example, in a video of a basketball that makes a hoop explode, the net appears to be restored automatically following the explosion. Sora uses arrangements of pixels to predict new pixel configurations, but without trying to understand the cultural context of the images. This is why the images and videos generated by Sora <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/sora-cant-handle-the-truth">seem correct at the pixel level</a> but <em>globally</em> wrong. Thus, OpenAI’s claim that “<a href="https://openai.com/research/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators">scaling video generation models is a promising path towards building general purpose simulators of the physical world</a>” is open to doubt.</p>
<p>LLMs do not yet approximate the human brain; generative video models do not approximate the physical world; and human intelligence is so much more than combining formal linguistic competence with complete models of thought, or making creative videos that respect the physical constraints of the world. Human intelligence is not limited to specific domains either but exists in the open to challenge currently held views. Ask Noah Chomsky and he will respond that generative models like ChatGPT are essentially “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/opinion/noam-chomsky-chatgpt-ai.html">high-tech plagiarism</a>”. Human consciousness includes a sense of self which machines will not be able to replicate anytime soon – or perhaps never will, since a human brain and a computer are <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-consciousness/#:~:text=Pondering%20this%20question%2C%20it's%20important,necessary%20nor%20sufficient%20for%20consciousness.">not the same</a>. Human consciousness is coupled with curiosity, imagination, intuition, emotions, desires, purpose, objectives, wisdom and even humour. If we think about humour, a good sense of humour means thinking outside of the box and connecting concepts and situations in novel ways, which is something that machines are unable to do. Also, by thinking outside the box, humans are able to <em>consciously</em> ask a variety of questions – the most <em>extraordinary</em> of which have led to major leaps in our understanding of the world around us.</p>
<p><em>Reasonable</em> questions can be posed by many and answered logically (some even by machines) using the standard scientific process of experimental design, controls and hypothesis validation. In this context, the faster and more efficient exploration of search space by learning methods, complemented by the delegation of repetitive tasks to machines, will <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/07/05/1075865/eric-schmidt-ai-will-transform-science/">allow scientists to conduct experiments at greater scale</a> while focusing on designing optimal solutions. Beyond reasonable questions and expected results is the concept of <em>serendipity</em> that machines cannot yet be made to grasp. Some of the greatest discoveries in the history of science are indeed serendipitous (accidental), including the discovery of insulin, penicillin, smallpox vaccination, the anti-malarial drug quinine, X-rays, nylon and the anaesthetic effects of ether and nitrous oxide.<sup>30</sup> Turning accidents into discoveries requires having a questioning mind that can view data from several perspectives and connect seemingly unrelated pieces of information instead of discarding unusual results right away.</p>
<p>And yet beyond serendipitous discoveries we have <em>extraordinary</em> questions, which machines are as yet incapable of asking. Extraordinary questions lie outside of our current frame of knowledge and require an illogical step that is often the product of letting one’s mind wander freely.<sup>31</sup> A classical example here is when Einstein was trying to modify Maxwell’s equations so that they were no longer in contradiction with the constant speed of light that had been observed. After trying to modify these equations for years, Einstein eventually realised that it was not Maxwell’s fault. Rather, our notion of time was incorrect. Einstein thus stumbled upon the very question that led to the idea that the rate at which time passes depends on one’s frame of reference. While machines follow rules, the revolutionary ideas of Einstein, Newton, Darwin, Galileo, Wittgenstein and many others did not follow any rules established at the time. Therefore, the real danger in thinking that we can rely on “intelligent” machines to achieve a human level of imagination, intuition, wisdom or purpose anytime soon is that the world will become an even more statistically predictable place.</p>

<p>What do <a href="https://www.simmons-simmons.com/en/publications/clq2gkar900fcu2ewb904uhrj/inappropriate-use-of-chatgpt-exposed-in-tax-case">defence cases in litigation</a>, statistical analyses, book summaries and a description of <a href="https://twitter.com/jimalkhalili/status/1621454981097209857/photo/1">Young’s double slit experiment in the manner of poet Robert Burns</a> have in common? They are all tasks that people have rightly or wrongly attempted to delegate to large language models.</p>
<p>The playground of generative AI algorithms based on large language models extends well beyond the space of generating text-based language but includes creating images, videos and even music from prompts. The capabilities of these algorithms, and the ubiquity of tasks that large language models like OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models can have a go at is striking. These large language models and the chatbots and so on based on them have also been catapulted into the centre of mainstream public attention with huge success – who has not heard of ChatGPT? The net result has been something akin to a feeding frenzy as individuals and businesses alike strive to be among the first to benefit from them.</p>
<p>Like others, many data scientists closely familiar with these kinds of algorithms share some enthusiasm for their potential utility, but many also advocate an element of caution. There are some obvious caveats, including accuracy and cost – not just financially but also in terms of the huge energy costs to run these algorithms, a real world consequence that is affecting the planet in the present day but is often eclipsed by fears that AI might take over the world some time in the future. Another concern is security. Should you be sharing the information you are working from with a third party anyway? However, while a lot of attention has focused on what these algorithms can do, fewer have been asking what they actually do – what we know about the initial programming, the training data, the final algorithm and the range of possible outputs, all of which provide useful pointers as to whether a particular algorithm is appropriate for the task in hand, and how best to benefit from it.</p>

<p>Definitions of artificial intelligence vary, often circling around the theme of a system reaching an “intelligent” decision or output based on multiple inputs, although how “intelligent” might be defined can be hairier still. Nonetheless, there is currently largely a consensus that some kind of machine learning is a route to achieving it. Through machine learning “you are letting the computer adjust the importance of its inputs, and their relationships, to determine an appropriate output” as Napier chief data scientist and chair of the Royal Statistical Society DS &amp; AI Section <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/janetbastiman/?originalSubdomain=uk">Janet Bastiman</a> describes it. The term “machine learning” was first proposed by IBM scientist Arthur Samuel in 1952, and it has largely been achieved by two approaches. One is “random forests”, based on constructing multiple decision trees. The other is the neural networks first devised by American psychologist Frank Rosenblatt and simulated at IBM in 1957. Here, a set of artificial neurons – components closer to a capacitor than a biological neuron – is connected to another layer of neurons, which is connected to another layer of neurons, and so on (Figure 1). Crucially the connections are strengthened or not through “learning” based on training data that allows the network to recognise patterns and extract meaningful features.</p>

<p>“Machine learning is just like linear regression with tonnes of bells and whistles,” says <a href="https://www.danielawitten.com/">Daniela Witten</a>, professor of mathematical statistics at the University of Washington in the US, referring to a statistical method for fitting a line to a set of data points that dates back over a hundred years. There are many other traditional approaches to statistical learning that may be nonlinear and so on, but as an example of the “bells and whistles” Witten describes, whereas a traditional regression model might have 5 inputs or variables, the machine learning version might have 15 million, and instead of assuming it is linear the fit is allowed to be more flexible and so on. However, the fundamental statistical ideas underlying both sets of models are the same. For this reason, although some may beg to differ, she feels doing machine learning before you understand statistics is like trying to jump rope before you can walk. “It’s not that you can’t do it but why would you?” she adds.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, machine learning can be classified two ways. One is “supervised”, which means that the training data is somehow labelled, for instance with a known output collected from real world records. The alternative is “unsupervised” where the algorithm is set the task of finding a way to learn relationships between input data itself. There are also neural network approaches that fall somewhere between the two, such as reinforcement learning where an algorithm may generate outputs for a task at random such that its performance is initially poor but improves with feedback to reinforce generation of outputs that are closer to those desired. An approach that enjoyed great popularity for a time used another machine learning algorithm to provide this feedback, which would initially also be a poor judge but improve as pitted against the algorithm learning to do the task – generative adversarial networks (<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2014/file/5ca3e9b122f61f8f06494c97b1afccf3-Paper.pdf">GANs</a>). GANs are still used a lot, but usually in a pipeline and may be pre-trained so they are not starting from scratch like they used to.</p>
<p>As the number of layers increased from just a few, the term “deep learning” was adopted along with alternative structures. The first models operated with every neuron in each layer connected to every neuron in the previous layer. “This is very wasteful because not every part of your input relates to each other that much,” says <a href="https://petar-v.com/">Petar Veličković</a>, staff research scientist at Google DeepMind and affiliated lecturer at the University of Cambridge. He cites images as among the first scenarios where people began to implement a tweak to the approach in what is called a convolutional neural network. Based on the assumption that the pixels for each object in an image sit adjacent to each other rather than at opposing corners of the image, the neurons in a convolutional neural network connect only with the neurons in the next layer that are nearby in the image space. In this way the convolutional neural network assumes a kind of structure in the input data – that the image is contiguous, so the pixels for edges and so on are in contact.</p>

<p>“Transformers are also a neural network but they encode a different kind of structure,” Veličković tells Real World Data Science, as he describes the data architecture at the heart of the large language models creating such a buzz at present. Language has structure too – the letters make up words, which then make up sentences and so on. So it makes sense to program some of that structure into the algorithm rather than leaving it to work it all out. “You would need a lot more training data than there is on the internet to train a system without such structure by itself,” adds Veličković. Transformers structure the training data into tokens, and a key component first reported in 2017 is the way each token then connects with or <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/hash/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Abstract.html">“attends” to all other similar tokens</a> . Here whether they are “similar” is determined by their dot products, a multiplication technique for the kind of vector format of input numbers used for these tokens (Figure 2). Exploiting this “dot product attention” significantly improves the efficiency of the training process.</p>

<p>The transformer architecture proved very powerful as has been seen in the surge to prominence of various AI systems based on generative pre-trained transformer algorithms, such as ChatGPT, BERT and PaLM, although this likely has at least as much to do with the marketing of the recent releases as it does with the algorithm itself. “It was a small evolution rather than a revolution,” says Bastiman in reference to recent GPT releases, explaining that there was an increase in parameter size and the amount of data used for training that gave rise to something that could provide broader answers and was ready for mass market. Nonetheless she adds, “There had been GPT2, GPT1 and all the other previous ones had been released quietly and had all been quite good.”</p>
<p>The marketing spin has not stopped with the product releases as terms like “hallucination” have entered the lexicon to describe instances when the output is wrong and potentially dangerous. (Figure 3) “The language we are using to describe these models is different to how we describe human intelligence to deliberately instil the sense this is better,” adds Bastiman. “So even if the model is incorrect these terms imply that it is still doing something amazing.”</p>

<p>The success of this marketing does have its advantages as Veličković points out, thrusting AI in the spotlight, inviting people to try the algorithms, which thanks to a growth in web-based user interfaces like ChatGPT can reach a much broader audience. This is not only encouraging developers they are doing something potentially useful but prompting important discussions around the potential bias and ethics issues, which many would argue ought to be considered before anything else. Nonetheless Veličković also doubts whether the current AI fanfare can be attributed to advances in the algorithms they use alone, pointing out that neural networks have been around since the 1950s, and the 1980s and 1990s saw the invention of most of the building blocks we need to scale such systems up: the backpropagation algorithm, convolutional and recurrent neural networks, long-short term memory networks, and early variants of linear self-attention and graph neural networks. “It’s just that we needed gamers,” he tells <em>Real World Data Science</em>, suggesting that hardware and engineering have been key to the recent successes of AI. “We needed people to drive the development of graphics cards which are really good hardware for training these things.”</p>
<p>Clearly advances in processing power and the hardware such as GPUs to manage it so that it is possible to compute these algorithms massively affects their potential impact. Although the field no longer relies on GPUs developed for gamers, GPUs are still widely used, as they offer such a good return on investment and are easier to get hold of than alternatives like tensor processing units. Certainly a significant development over the past decade or so is the increase in size of not just the data sets but the algorithms themselves. Implementing algorithms at such colossal scales that require data centres imposes incredibly challenging requirements on the hardware and the electrical and computational engineering involved to set them running and keep them from failure. “When you have a data centre, failure is a common thing,” says Veličković, listing multiple vulnerabilities that balloon at scale such as hardware failures, electrical failures, even apparently exotic events like solar flares can flip bits and scramble data leading to nonsense output. “People underestimate this but good engineering is now the bread and butter of how these systems work.”</p>

<section id="managing-expectations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="managing-expectations">Managing expectations</h2>
<p>The explosion in scale has also created fundamental distinctions from how people work with machine learning algorithms versus statistical methods. Witten highlights “the ability to gauge uncertainty” by quantifying parameters such as confidence intervals and error bars as a key contribution of statistics. “Often with these machine learning models things get very complicated and we do not yet have a way to quantify that uncertainty.”</p>
<p>This quantifying of finite parameters contrasts with the kind of output achieved with the generative AI applications that have grabbed media focus recently. For instance, asking a large language model to describe Young’s double slit experiment in the style of Robert Burns may sound quite a specific prompt, and it may seem impressive if the algorithm returns something akin to what was asked, but the number of possible responses that could be deemed “correct” are infinite. A lot of applications of generative AI – many with more real world impact than describing iconic experiments in archaic scotch rhyme – similarly have a vast set of reasonable outputs.</p>

<p>“We shouldn’t be surprised if ChatGPT does well with a question that has a million reasonable answers,” says Witten, contrasting these scenarios with questions that she suggests might have more real-world importance, like whether a patient with breast cancer will respond to a particular treatment. “Actually ChatGPT often gets into trouble if there is a problem with just one answer, and that answer is not part of the training set.”</p>
<p>For predictive AI there is often only one useful answer – the outcome that will come to pass. This has implications if machine learning is used for predictions, particularly if it is in real world settings that affect real people. “If you are deploying an AI model for some healthcare application like what breast cancer treatment you are going to respond best to, we really better make sure that the model works, and that we understand the uncertainty of those predictions,” says Witten. She feels that over the past few years, the machine learning community has increasingly recognized the importance of bringing statistical thinking to bear within the context of complex machine learning/AI algorithms: in particular, interpretability and uncertainty quantification have become major areas of interest in machine learning. Witten suggests that statistics is making progress here citing as an example conformal inference, “which allows recalibration of the predictions of a machine learning model in order to quantify uncertainty appropriately.”</p>
</section>
<section id="explain-yourself" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="explain-yourself">Explain yourself</h2>
<p>Understanding the uncertainties of output is one thing, but many of these algorithms have now reached the kind of scale that totally obfuscates what they are doing with the input data to reach their outputs. There may be specialists who understand how they are programmed but there are just too many variables to track so that even for them, the final process the algorithm lands on for generating its output from the various inputs is a black box with no neat mathematical description, unlike statistical techniques like regression.</p>
<p>“You can draw a picture with circles and arrows, and arrows cross in a certain way, but you don’t have a clear idea of how one feature that you started with maps to the output,” says Witten. “On an actual quantitative level of scientific understanding we don’t have that.” If decisions are being made for and about people based on AI, people will also sometimes want to know how that conclusion was drawn. “When we want to make decisions there’s a level of deferred trust,” says Bastiman citing a <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/project-explain#:~:text=This%20gap%20in%20AI%20explainability,robust%2C%20reliable%2C%20and%20safe">work by the Alan Turing Institute</a> that began in the late 2010s. “We as humans want explanations from machines in the same scenarios that we want them from humans but that’s not going to be the same for all people.” For example, a person who has had a bad experience in the past will need more convincing than one who has not. Janet suggests that a very normal cognitive bias can be generalised as most people wanting more explanation if the model output is not in their favour. “Similarly, a person accepted for a job where AI is used, may not require any explanation, while another candidate the AI rejected may challenge the decision and want to know why.”</p>
<p>Hybrid implementations including a human in the loop may help to a degree. However, to get a handle on the workings of the algorithm itself, Bastiman points out that it is possible to introduce layers in the algorithm that will help extract how the output is reached even for unsupervised neural networks. “That’s where a lot of effort goes from data scientists and machine learning engineers to make sure the model has that level of transparency and makes sense,” she adds, emphasising the need to ensure a model has these features before it is released and put in use. The process is far from straightforward as the explanation needs to be at the right level and with the right terminology for a range of audiences, be they data scientists, quality assurance professionals, decision makers, end users or impacted individuals. “People say you can’t explain things when what they really mean is that it’s difficult.”</p>
<p>Veličković suggests a lot could be gained in terms of being able to analyse AI algorithms by marrying them with elements of classical algorithms, which are “nicely implemented and interpretable.” Classical algorithms are also impervious to changes in the input data such as an increase by a factor of 10, which can completely throw an algorithm based on machine learning. “The problem is they are trained to be really useful and give you an answer at all times so they won’t even give you a confidence estimate, they will just try to answer even if the answer is completely broken,” he adds. A lot of his research has focused on “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389921000994">out-of-distribution generalisation</a>” – the way classical algorithms work with any input data – to see how these features might be sewn into AI to extract the best of both worlds. “There’s a lot of research to be done still but our findings so far indicate that if you want out-of-distribution generalisation you need to look at what makes your problem special and put some of those properties inside your neural network model.”</p>
<p>Even what we know about the way the algorithm reaches a decision has caused concern when it comes to critical real-world applications – for example, <a href="https://www.bu.edu/articles/2023/do-algorithms-reduce-bias-in-criminal-justice/">to determine the likelihood that someone convicted of a crime will reoffend</a>. (More on this to come in the special issue article on ethics). With many commercial algorithms the details of the training data are unknown or essentially constitute the whole internet, which as Witten points out is “a pretty bad place a lot of the time.” While ChatGPT may seem an unlikely choice for anything like gauging risk for recidivism or cancer treatments, concerns remain over biases propagating in AI generated content we might consume through marketing campaigns and other activities. “Even just thinking about deploying AI/machine learning models in critical real-world settings without the associated statistical understanding is just very deeply problematic,” says Witten, emphasising the importance of not just statisticians but also ethicists for tackling these challenges.</p>
<p>The fact is many of us are already interacting with multiple machine learning/AI models on a daily basis through recommendations, search engines and predictive text. “If we are going to deploy these [machine learning algorithms] at scale in a way that will affect human lives, then we first need to understand the implications for humans of these models,” says Witten. “This includes both statistical and ethical considerations.”</p>
<p>Coming up: Forthcoming articles in this special issue will look at machine learning and human-level intelligence, issues around data, techniques for evaluation, gauging workforce impact, governance, best practice and living with AI</p>

  <title>Democratizing Data: Using natural language processing and machine learning to capture dataset usage</title>
  <dc:creator>Brian Tarran</dc:creator>
  <link>https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/interviews/posts/2024/03/11/democratizing-data.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Figuring out how much money is spent annually on collecting and publishing datasets is a challenge. According to the World Bank, it is <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/how-much-should-governments-spend-data">“painfully hard to obtain”</a> information just on government spending on data, never mind all the other bodies and organisations who invest in the creation of data assets. But there’s an even more challenging figure to pin down: How much value does all this data provide? By and large, there is very little data – or systematic collection of data – on dataset usage. There’s no easy way to find all the users of a particular dataset and to see how the data has been used, or what research topics it may have contributed to.</p>
<p>Writing in the <a href="https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/g6e8noiy/release/2">Harvard Data Science Review in April 2022</a>, <a href="https://julialane.org/">Julia Lane</a> and others explained that “the current approach to finding what data sets are used to answer scientific questions … is largely manual and ad hoc.” They went on to argue: “Better information on the use of data is likely to have at least two results: (i) government agencies might use the information to describe the return on investment in data sets and (ii) scientists might use the information to reduce the time taken to search and discover other empirical research.”</p>
<p>This hope for a better understanding of how datasets are used and the value they provide underpins the creation of “Democratizing Data: A Search and Discovery Platform for Public Data Assets.”</p>
<p>As described on <a href="https://democratizingdata.ai/">the platform’s homepage</a>, Democratizing Data “describes how datasets identified by federal agencies have been used in scientific research. It uses machine learning algorithms to search over 90 million documents and find how datasets are cited, in what publications, and what topics they are used to study.”</p>
<p>But this is just the start of what Lane thinks the project could eventually achieve, as she explains in this interview.</p>
<div class="keyline">
<hr>
</div>
<p><strong>How did the Democratizing Data platform come about?</strong><br>
It emerged from three things, really, and I can trace the start of it back to 2016, when I was asked to build a secure environment that could host confidential microdata in order to inform the work of the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/management/commission_evidence">Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking</a>.<sup>1</sup> They asked me to lead on this because I had built the <a href="https://www.norc.org/services-solutions/data-enclave.html">NORC remote access Data Enclave at the University of Chicago</a> 10 years before that.</p>
<p>This was the first step towards Democratizing Data.</p>
<p>The second step was figuring out how to create value from the data in the secure environment, because we knew that if we couldn’t create value, government agencies weren’t going to put their data into it.</p>
<p>But how do you figure out what agencies are going to want to do with the data in a secure environment? It’s difficult to get them to tell you what they want, so I thought, well, why don’t we build training classes, put people in these training classes and have them work on problems with their own data? That way, we’re going to know what problems they have so that we can address them.</p>
<p>So, step 1 was build secure environment. Step 2 was build capacity and identify the questions that are of interest to agencies so that they would put data into the secure environment. That led to the training classes that Frauke Kreuter, Rayid Ghani, and I put together, which are described here.</p>
<p>But then what happened was, people kept coming to me in the classes and asking, “Who else has worked with these data, and who can I go to and ask questions?”</p>
<p>I could give them a list of people, but that list would be biased by my age and race and sex and the people I know. What about those people who are doing really interesting stuff with these data that I happen not to know about?</p>
<p>So, that’s how Democratizing Data got started. I thought, really the best way to give a full answer to those sorts of questions is to figure out what datasets are being used in research publications.</p>
<p>Now, how was I going do that? I could read all the publications and manually write notes about who the authors were, and what the topics were, and what datasets they used. But that’s not realistic. So, I thought, well, maybe we could combine natural language processing techniques with machine learning so that you could “read” all these publications and find out how datasets are cited.</p>

<p>We’re searching for ways to measure how datasets are used, how they’re valued, and so on. Federal statistical data and Elsevier’s Scopus have been a great starting point for us, but the broader vision is to incorporate other datasets and other publication databases.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Would this have been a problem that needed solving if there were common, established citation standards and practices for datasets?</strong><br>
There <em>are</em> great citation practices for datasets, and we’ve had them for 15 years. Back when I was a National Science Foundation (NSF) program officer, everyone was saying, well, if we just get the plumbing right, people will come and use it. Well, they don’t. Even when there are DOIs available and they’re relatively easy to cite, people don’t. The plumbing’s there, we built it, but they didn’t come.</p>
<p>So, I think there has to be a demand-side piece, and we talk about that in one of the papers in an upcoming special issue of the <a href="https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/">Harvard Data Science Review</a>: How do you create an incentive structure so that people do provide information about how they’ve used data? My thinking was that, suppose we can find out who’s using what data. Then the incentive structure to an academic is “your name in lights”: you are the world’s living expert in orange carrots with green stripes, or whatever. So, we would read the publications, find the datasets, and then you could have a leaderboard of the people who have done the most work in a particular field, and then people would have an incentive both to cite datasets and to let you know when you miss things. And that was when I thought, well, let’s put all this information up in a dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>So, is the grand vision for this to create a platform that, essentially, any data owner – anyone who publishes datasets – could plug into, connect to, and understand how other people are using their datasets?</strong><br>
That’s right. The grand vision is basically to set up a search and discovery portal. Originally, my thinking was that would be super helpful for people just starting out in a field; for a new graduate student or a postdoc to say, “I want to figure out what work has been done on recidivism of welfare recipients relative to access to jobs and neighborhood characteristics,” for example, and for them to see what datasets are available and how they have been used.</p>
<p>But from the data producer side it’d also be useful to know: Who’s using the datasets? Where are the gaps? Where are we maybe not reaching as many people as we thought we were, and how can we change that?</p>
<p>So, while the original idea was to build a platform for researchers, plans changed when the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-115publ435/pdf/PLAW-115publ435.pdf">Evidence Act</a> passed, and agencies were required to produce usage statistics for their datasets.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>We started a pilot with the US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Economic Research Service (ERS). They have been a huge supporter and helped us work through a lot of the issues. Then, when we began showing around the ERS wireframes and ideas, the NSF National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics joined in, and so did USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service and the National Center for Education Statistics and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
<p>So, we have these agencies involved and they’ve really been the drivers, the intellectual partners, pushing the design and the structure forward.</p>
<p><strong>I’ve had a chance to play around with some of the <a href="https://democratizingdata.ai/tools/dashboards/">public dashboards you’ve released on Tableau</a>, and I really like the way you can explore dataset usage from different start points and end up with a list of publications that use those datasets. My question is, though, how have you connected all this up – datasets and publications?</strong><br>
Our start point was scientific publications because these are pretty well curated. We ended up working with Elsevier because Scopus [Elsevier’s abstract and citation database] is a well-curated corpus and they’ve got the associated publication metadata well curated.</p>
<p>So, we have the Scopus corpus, and we then ran <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/coleridgeinitiative-show-us-the-data">a Kaggle competition</a> to develop machine learning models to identify candidate snippets of text from scientific papers that seem like they might be referring to a dataset.</p>
<p>Human researchers would then validate those snippets as either referring to a dataset or not, and once they’ve validated the publication-to-dataset dyad, we then pull in all the metadata associated with the publication: authors, institutions, key topics, publication year, countries, etc. – all this information gets piped over to the dashboards.</p>
<p><strong>You published <a href="https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/g6e8noiy/release/2">a Harvard Data Science Review article about this competition a couple of years ago</a>, and from that I understand that you can actually get quite far with a simple string-matching method for finding datasets, but you would still miss a lot of citations using this approach because of the variability in the way people refer to datasets.</strong><br>
That’s right. There were three different models that were developed, and each one picks up different aspects of how authors mention data in publications, and all three have been extremely useful. We learned a lot about the variety of ways in which researchers cite the data that they use.</p>
<p>It turns out that more people do cite datasets in references than we had originally thought, but usually they don’t cite a DOI, they cite the URL or they cite the exact name of the dataset, so string search of references and URLs pulls out quite a lot of information that the DOIs, <em>per se</em>, don’t.</p>
<p><strong>What are the next steps for scaling up the Democratizing Data work?</strong><br>
I think it is more of a sociotechnical issue than a technical one. We have the plumbing, but really what we need to do is to figure out the incentives for researchers. We need to build a community around the data, which is what’s happened with code and the sharing of code on platforms like GitHub.</p>
<p>Obviously, our initial focus has been on federal statistical data, but there’s also a lot of interest in how administrative data or streaming data are being used.</p>
<p>The advantage of starting with statistical data is that they have names. As we learn more about citation patterns, though, it may be that we don’t need precise names. What may happen is that the community starts converging on common terminologies for datasets. That happens in a lot of fields.</p>
<p>At the moment, it feels a little bit like the Wild West. We’re searching for ways to measure how datasets are used, how they’re valued, and so on. Federal statistical data and Elsevier’s Scopus have been a great starting point for us, but the broader vision is to incorporate other datasets and other publication databases like arXiv and Semantic Scholar. But all those other datasets that are out there, they need to be curated and documented in some way and that’s a huge task, so the solution has got to be community curation and sharing, right?</p>
<p>If we don’t build a community around the data, we’re just going to have really bad information, really bad analysis, and really bad statistics on the value that our datasets – all these data assets – provide. My colleague <a href="https://www.rti.org/event/rti-fellow-program-distinguished-lecture-series-democratizing-data">Nancy Potok gave a talk a couple of days ago</a> in which she said that our future depends on this – and it really does.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>It’s not easy to leave a brilliant group of people you’ve worked with for almost a decade, but in a month’s time I’ll be moving on from the Royal Statistical Society (RSS).</p>
<p>When I joined RSS in June 2014 I was looking for new challenges. I wanted to find out more about the ways statistics and data are used to understand and solve problems and inform decisions in science, business and industry, public policy, health… I could go on! Working for the RSS certainly delivered on that front: as editor of <a href="https://significancemagazine.com/">Significance</a> for eight years and of Real World Data Science more recently, I have had many opportunities to learn.</p>
<p>Pretty much every day of my working life for the past nine years, eight months or so involved speaking with expert statisticians and data scientists or reading about their work. When there were things I didn’t understand, they were always happy to explain. When I shared my ideas for how to make their articles clearer or more readable, they took the time to listen. Together, we worked to create accessible, engaging stories about statistics and data. There have been hundreds of these collaborations over the years – too many to namecheck individually – but I have enjoyed them all, and I’ve learned something from each of them.</p>
<p>Before I head off to pursue a new set of challenges and learning opportunities, I want to say a big thank you to all the RSS staff and members, past and present, that I’ve been lucky to call my colleagues. Thank you also to the staff and members of the American Statistical Association who have been valued partners on Significance over the years and now RWDS too. It’s been a privilege to work with you all.</p>
<p>The chance to launch RWDS has been a particular highlight of my time at RSS, and I am grateful to have had the support and input of The Alan Turing Institute and many of its wonderful staff and researchers on this project. I’m excited to see the site continue to grow and develop into a valuable resource for the data science community, and I look forward to reading an upcoming series of articles that will explore the statistical and data science perspectives on AI – stay tuned for more on this soon.</p>
<p>Statistics and data will continue to be a big part of my life, so this isn’t “goodbye.” Instead, I’ll just say, let’s keep in touch – and thank you for reading!</p>

  <title>What is data science? A closer look at science’s latest priority dispute</title>
  <dc:creator>Jonathan Auerbach, David Kepplinger, and Nicholas Rios</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>What is data science, and where did it come from? Is data science a new and exciting set of skills, necessary for analyzing 21st century data? Or is it (as some have claimed) a rebranding of statistics, which has carefully developed time-honored methods for data analysis over the past century?</p>
<p>Priority disputes – disagreements over who deserves credit for a new scientific theory or method – date back to the beginning of science. Famous examples include the invention of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz–Newton_calculus_controversy">calculus</a> and <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-9/issue-3/Gauss-and-the-Invention-of-Least-Squares/10.1214/aos/1176345451.full">ordinary least squares</a>. But this latest dispute calls into question the novelty of an entire discipline.</p>
<p>In this article, we use two popular data science algorithms to examine the difference between data science, statistics, and other occupations. We find that in terms of the preparation required to become a data scientist, data science reflects both the work of natural sciences managers – individuals who oversee research operations in the natural sciences – and statisticians and mathematicians. This suggests that data science is a shared enterprise among science and math, and thus those trained in the natural sciences have as much claim to data science as those trained in mathematics and statistics.</p>
<p>In terms of the role a data scientist serves relative to other occupations, however, we find that data science is closest to statistics by far. Both occupations are fast growing and central among the occupations that work with data, suggesting a data scientist serves the same function as a statistician. But this function may be changing. While the centrality of statistics has declined over the past decade relative to other occupations, the centrality of data science has grown. In fact, data science has now surpassed statistics as the most central fast-growing occupation.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="we-examine-the-role-of-data-science-using-data-science">We examine the role of data science using data science</h2>
<p>Everyone seems to agree that data science requires skills traditionally associated with a variety of different occupations. <a href="http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram">Drew Conway</a>, for example, describes data science as a combination of math and statistics, substantive (domain) expertise, and “hacking” skills (see Figure&nbsp;1). In dispute is the relative importance of those skills. <a href="https://www.statisticsviews.com/article/nate-silver-what-i-need-from-statisticians/">Some</a> <a href="https://imstat.org/2014/10/01/ims-presidential-address-let-us-own-data-science/">have</a> <a href="https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2013/07/01/datascience/">argued</a> that data science is basically statistics – and that 20th century statisticians like <a href="https://imstat.org/2023/09/30/hand-writing-john-tukey-the-first-data-scientist/">John Tukey</a> have long possessed the data science skills traditionally associated with computer science and the natural sciences. <a href="http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram">Others</a> <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2013/11/14/statistics-least-important-part-data-science/">have</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211219192027/http://www.dataists.com/2010/09/a-taxonomy-of-data-science/">argued</a> that data science is truly interdisciplinary, and statistical thinking only plays a small role. But while opinions on data science abound, few appear to be based on data or science.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>To that end, we use two popular data science algorithms, naïve Bayes and eigen centrality (eigen decomposition), to investigate the question: What is data science? Both algorithms use data listing the training a worker must generally complete to work in an occupation, such as data science. Specifically, we use the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/resources.aspx?y=56">CIP SOC Crosswalk</a> provided by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and US National Center for Education Statistics, which links the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/Default.aspx?y=56">Classification of Instructional Programs</a> – the standard classification of educational fields of study into roughly 2,000 instructional programs – with the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/soc/">Standard Occupational Classification</a> – the standard classification of professions into roughly 700 occupations.</p>
<p>Our main assumption is that the skills required to work in an occupation can be represented by the instructional programs that prepare students to work in that occupation. For example, the occupation “data scientists” is associated with 35 instructional programs, such as data science, statistics, artificial intelligence, computational science, mathematical biology, and econometrics. The occupation “statisticians” is associated with 26 instructional programs, including data science, statistics, and econometrics, but not artificial intelligence, computational science, or mathematical biology.</p>
<p>The algorithms we employ consider occupations to be similar if they have many instructional programs in common. Data scientists and statisticians share 14 degrees, suggesting they are similar: Half the programs that prepare students to be a statistician also prepare students to be a data scientist. In contrast, data scientists and computer programmers share six degrees in common, suggesting they are less similar; computer programmers have 17 degrees overall so only a third of the programs that prepare students to be a computer programmer also prepare students to be a data scientist.<sup>2</sup></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-science-is-a-shared-enterprise-among-science-and-math">Data science is a shared enterprise among science and math</h2>
<p>We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier#Multinomial_naive_Bayes">naïve Bayes</a> to measure the similarity between each occupation and data science in terms of the preparation required to work in that occupation. Specifically, we first pretend that the occupation “data scientist” did not exist and then use Bayes’ rule to calculate the probability that a hypothetical group of workers with the 35 degrees associated with data science could have come from one of the roughly 700 other occupations. The higher the measure, the more consistent that occupation is with data science.</p>
<p>The use of Bayes’ rule is appealing because the similarity between a given occupation and data science takes into account the similarities between every other occupation and data science. Our use of Bayes’ rule is naïve in the sense that – before collecting the data – we assume these workers are equally likely to have come from any occupation.</p>
<p>The occupations with the largest probabilities, and thus most related to data science, are summarized in Figure&nbsp;2. We find that the hypothetical workers have a 50% chance of being natural sciences managers and a 50% chance of being statisticians or mathematicians.<sup>3</sup> We conclude that data science is a shared enterprise among science and math, and thus those trained in natural sciences have as much claim to data science as those trained in mathematics and statistics.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-science-is-closest-to-statistics-in-its-role-among-other-occupations">Data science is closest to statistics in its role among other occupations</h2>
<p>We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality#Eigenvector_centrality">eigen centrality</a> (eigen decomposition) to measure the similarity of each occupation in terms of its role relative to other occupations. Specifically, we calculate the principal right singular vector of the adjacency matrix denoting whether an instructional program (row) is associated with an occupation (column).<sup>4</sup> An occupation has high eigen centrality when the instructional programs that prepare a worker for that occupation also prepare that worker for many other occupations as well. This suggests that the higher the measure, the more central the role of the occupation relative to other occupations.</p>
<p>The eigen centrality of each occupation is displayed in Figure&nbsp;3. Each point represents an occupation, the x-axis denotes the centrality of the occupation, and the y-axis denotes the percent growth of the occupation as <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/">predicted</a> by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics over the next decade. The figure demonstrates that data scientists and statisticians occupy nearly identical positions: Both are fast growing and central to the other occupations that work with data. In contrast, natural sciences managers are central but growing much more slowly, suggesting a role closer to managers. We conclude that – though data scientists are prepared similarly to natural sciences managers – a data scientist serves the same function as a statistician.</p>

<p>But this function may be changing. Figure&nbsp;4 shows the centrality (x-axis) of each occupation (y-axis) in 2010 and 2020. Green bars denote increases from 2010 to 2020 while yellow bars denote decreases. We find that the centrality of statisticians has declined over the past decade relative to other occupations, while the centrality of data scientists has grown. In fact, data science has now surpassed statistics as the most central fast-growing occupation. We conclude that though a data scientist and a statistician serve similar roles today, those roles may change as the workforce changes. Note that the occupation classifications changed in 2018, and we used the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/crosswalks_used_by_agencies.htm">crosswalk</a> provided by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to make these comparisons.</p>

<p>The findings in this section are based on the adjacency matrix that encodes whether an instructional program (row) is associated with an occupation (column). A more detailed summary of the matrix is provided in Figure&nbsp;5, which depicts the matrix as a network graph. Larger nodes represent occupations that are growing faster, while nodes closer to the center of the network represent more central occupations. The figure is interactive. You can zoom in to see the similar positions between data scientists and statisticians, which are both large (fast growing) and central.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-data-science-statistics">Is data science statistics?</h2>
<p>We conclude that individuals trained in managing natural sciences research – a slow growing occupation – are turning to data science – a much faster growing occupation, and one which currently serves a role like that of a statistician. But if present trends continue, data science is poised to eclipse the historic role of the statistician as central to the occupations that work with data.</p>
<p>This suggests that while data science may be new and exciting, the role served by the data scientist is not particularly new. This does not mean that data scientists necessarily use the same time-honored methods for data analysis as statisticians. It is the authors’ experience, however, that many data science tools are in fact statistical. Indeed, the two data science algorithms we used in this article are both taught to students as new and exciting, but in reality are centuries-old methods steeped in statistical history.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether data science is or is not statistics, the occupation “data scientist” has proven immensely popular, capturing a zeitgeist that has eluded statistics. This is best evidenced by the fact that data science – and not statistics – has been crowned the <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century">sexiest</a> job of the 21st century. But if statistics has not enjoyed the popularity of data science, perhaps the real question in need of answering is: What is statistics?</p>

  <title>£10m for UK regulators to ‘jumpstart’ AI capabilities, as government commits to white paper approach</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The UK government this week announced a £10 million investment to “jumpstart regulators’ AI capabilities” as part of its commitment to a “pro-innovation approach to AI regulation.” But will this be sufficient to answer criticisms that it has so far been “too slow” to give regulators the tools they need to police the growing usage of AI?</p>
<p>It was March last year when a Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) white paper first set out the government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-regulation-a-pro-innovation-approach/white-paper">principles- and context-based approach to regulating artificial intelligence</a>. This proposed to focus regulatory attention on “the context in which AI is deployed” rather than target specific technologies. Under this model, existing regulators, including the Information Commissioner’s Office, Ofcom, and the Competition and Markets Authority, would be responsible for ensuring that technologies deployed within their domains adhered to established rules – e.g., data protection regulation – and a common set of principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safety, security and robustness.</li>
<li>Appropriate transparency and explainability.</li>
<li>Fairness.</li>
<li>Accountability and governance.</li>
<li>Contestability and redress.</li>
</ul>
<p>The approach was broadly well received, as was clear from a debate at techUK’s <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/editors-blog/posts/2023/12/08/digital-ethics-summit.html">Digital Ethics Summit</a> last December. However, concerns were expressed about whether regulators would be funded sufficiently to meet the expectations set out in the March white paper. Also, the Royal Statistical Society, in <a href="https://rss.org.uk/RSS/media/File-library/Policy/2023/RSS-AI-white-paper-response-v2-2.pdf">its response to the white paper</a>, worried that “splitting responsibilities for regulating the use of AI between existing regulators does not meet the scale of the challenge,” and that “central leadership is required to give a clear, coherent and easily communicable framework that can be applied to all sectors.”</p>
<p>While the DSIT white paper proposed that a range of “central functions” be created to support regulators, <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/170/communications-and-digital-committee/news/199728/uk-will-miss-ai-goldrush-unless-government-adopts-a-more-positive-vision/">evidence presented to a House of Lords inquiry</a> last November suggested that regulators “did not appear to know what was happening” with these mooted teams and were “keen to see progress” on this front.</p>
<p>In reporting the outcomes of its inquiry last week, the House of Lords Communications and Digital Committee concluded that government was being “too slow” to give regulators the tools required to meet the objectives set out in the white paper, and that “speedier resourcing of government‑led central support teams is needed.”</p>
<p>“Relying on existing regulators to ensure good outcomes from AI will only work if they are properly resourced and empowered,” the committee said.</p>
<p>The £10 million funding for regulators announced this week is therefore likely to be welcomed. Money is earmarked to “help regulators develop cutting-edge research and practical tools to monitor and address risks and opportunities in their sectors, from telecoms and healthcare to finance and education,” according to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-signals-step-change-for-regulators-to-strengthen-ai-leadership">a DSIT press release</a>. Speaking on February 6 at <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/68ecee17-2896-4002-8736-1608229db364?in=15:27:41">a hearing of the Lords Communications and Digital Committee</a>, Michelle Donelan, Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, said that the government would “stay on top” of what regulators need to be able to fulfil their responsibilities for regulating the use of AI in their sectors.</p>
<section id="consultation-response" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="consultation-response">Consultation response</h2>
<p>News of the funding for regulators came as part of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/ai-regulation-a-pro-innovation-approach-policy-proposals/outcome/a-pro-innovation-approach-to-ai-regulation-government-response">a long-awaited response by the government to the consultation on its AI regulation white paper</a>. The response essentially confirmed that the government was proceeding with its principles- and context-based approach to regulating AI, having received “strong support from stakeholders across society.”</p>
<p>This approach is right for today, the government said, “as it allows us to keep pace with rapid and uncertain advances in AI.” However, it acknowledged that “the challenges posed by AI technologies will ultimately require legislative action in every country once understanding of risk has matured.”</p>
<p>“Highly capable general-purpose AI systems” would, for example, present a particular challenge to the government’s current approach. It explained: “Even though some regulators can enforce existing laws against the developers of the most capable general-purpose systems within their current remits, the wide range of potential uses means that general-purpose systems do not currently fit neatly within the remit of any one regulator, potentially leaving risks without effective mitigations.”</p>
<p>As a next step in delivering on the white paper approach, the government is asking key regulators to publish an update on their strategic approach to AI by the end of April. This was welcomed by Royal Statistical Society (RSS) president Andrew Garrett, who said:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Urgency is certainly warranted, and the directive for key regulators to disclose their approach in the coming months is a positive development. Ensuring consistency and coherence not only among key regulators but also those who follow is crucial.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Garrett also <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/interviews/posts/2023/10/25/evaluating-ai.html">reiterated the need for government to engage with statisticians and data scientists</a>, particularly through its <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/posts/2023/12/06/ai-fringe.html">new AI Safety Institute</a> (AISI). In the white paper consultation response, AISI is billed as being “fundamental to informing the UK’s regulatory framework”: it will “advance the world’s knowledge of AI safety by carefully examining, evaluating, and testing new frontier AI systems” and will also “research new techniques for understanding and mitigating AI risk.” Garrett said:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“As always, fostering diversity of representation within government and regulatory bodies remains paramount; it cannot solely rely on input from major tech companies. It is especially important that the AI Safety Institute engages with a diverse array of voices, including statisticians and data scientists who play a pivotal role in both the development of AI systems and novel evaluation methodologies.”</p>
</blockquote>

<section id="risks-and-opportunities" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="risks-and-opportunities">Risks and opportunities</h2>
<p>Calls for a “diversity of representation within government and regulatory bodies” certainly chime with a warning bell sounded by the Lords Communications and Digital Committee last week, in the February 2 release of its <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/170/communications-and-digital-committee/news/199728/uk-will-miss-ai-goldrush-unless-government-adopts-a-more-positive-vision/">inquiry report into large language models and generative AI</a>. “Regulatory capture” by big commercial interests was highlighted as a danger to be avoided, amid concern that “the AI safety debate is being dominated by views narrowly focused on catastrophic risk, often coming from those who developed such models in the first place” and that “this distracts from more immediate issues like copyright infringement, bias and reliability.”<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The committee called for enhanced governance and transparency measures in DSIT and AISI to guard against regulatory capture, and for a rebalancing away from a “narrow focus on high-stakes AI safety” toward a “more positive vision for the opportunities [of AI] and a more deliberate focus on near-term risks” including cyber security and disinformation.</p>
<p>It also wants to see greater action by the government in support of copyright. “Some tech firms are using copyrighted material without permission, reaping vast financial rewards,” reads the report. “The legalities of this are complex but the principles remain clear. The point of copyright is to reward creators for their efforts, prevent others from using works without permission, and incentivise innovation. The current legal framework is failing to ensure these outcomes occur and the Government has a duty to act. It cannot sit on its hands for the next decade and hope the courts will provide an answer.”</p>
<p>Again, here’s RSS president Andrew Garrett’s take on the Lords committee report:</p>

  <title>UK government sets out 10 principles for use of generative AI</title>
  <dc:creator>Brian Tarran</dc:creator>
  <link>https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/editors-blog/posts/2024/01/22/gen-ai-framework.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The UK government has published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-ai-framework-for-hmg/generative-ai-framework-for-hmg-html">a framework for the use of generative AI</a>, setting out 10 principles for departments and staff to think about if using, or planning to use, this technology.</p>
<p>It covers the need to understand what generative AI is and its limitations, the lawful, ethical and secure use of the technology, and a requirement for “meaningful human control.”</p>
<p>The focus is on large language models (LLMs) as, according to the framework, these have “the greatest level of immediate application in government.”</p>
<p>It lists a number of promising use cases for LLMs, including the synthesise of complex data, software development, and summaries of text and audio. However, the document cautions against using generative AI for fully automated decision-making or in contexts where data is limited or explainability of decision-making is required. For example, it warns that:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“although LLMs can give the appearance of reasoning, they are simply predicting the next most plausible word in their output, and may produce inaccurate or poorly-reasoned conclusions.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on the issue of explainability, it says that:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“generative AI is based on neural networks, which are so-called ‘black boxes’. This makes it difficult or impossible to explain the inner workings of the model which has potential implications if in the future you are challenged to justify decisioning or guidance based on the model.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The framework goes on to discuss some of the practicalities of building generative AI solutions. It talks specifically about the value a multi-disciplinary team can bring to such projects, and emphasises the role of data scientists:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“data scientists … understand the relevant data, how to use it effectively, and how to build/train and test models.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It also speaks to the need to “understand how to monitor and mitigate generative AI drift, bias and hallucinations” and to have “a robust testing and monitoring process in place to catch these problems.”</p>
<p>What do you make of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-ai-framework-for-hmg/generative-ai-framework-for-hmg-html">Generative AI Framework for His Majesty’s Government</a>? What does it get right, and what needs more work?</p>

<p>New York State issued a policy on the <a href="https://its.ny.gov/acceptable-use-artificial-intelligence-technologies">Acceptable Use of Artificial Intelligence Technologies</a> earlier this month. Similar to the UK government framework, it references the need for human oversight of AI models and rules out use of “automated final decision systems.” There is also discussion of fairness, equity and explainability, and AI risk assessment and management.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The <a href="https://competition.statistics.gmu.edu/">2024 International Cherry Blossom Prediction Competition</a> will open for entries on February 1, and Real World Data Science is once again proud to be a sponsor.</p>
<p>Contestants are invited to submit predictions for the date cherry trees will bloom in 2024 at five different locations – Kyoto, Japan; Liestal-Weideli, Switzerland; Vancouver, Canada; and Washington, DC and New York City, USA.</p>
<p>The competition organisers will provide all the publicly available data they can find for the bloom dates of cherry trees in these locations, and contestants will then be challenged to use this data “in combination with any other publicly available data (e.g., climate data) to provide reproducible predictions of the peak bloom date.”</p>
<p>“For this competition, we seek accurate, interpretable predictions that offer strong narratives about the factors that determine when cherry trees bloom and the broader consequences for local and global ecosystems,” say the organisers. “Your task is to predict the peak bloom date for 2024 and to estimate a prediction interval, a lower and upper endpoint of dates during which peak bloom is most probable.”</p>
<p>So that organisers can reproduce the predictions, entrants must submit all data and code in a <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto document</a>.</p>
<p>There’s cash and prizes on offer for the best entries, including having your work featured on Real World Data Science. <a href="https://competition.statistics.gmu.edu/">Head on over to the competition website for full details and rules</a>.</p>
<p>And, if you are looking for some inspiration, check out this <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/ideas/tutorials/posts/2023/04/13/flowers.html">tutorial on the law of the flowering plants</a>, written by Jonathan Auerbach, a co-organiser of the prediction competition.</p>
<p>Good luck to all entrants!</p>

  <title>‘We absolutely have to transform and modernise our operation’ – US Census Bureau director Robert Santos</title>
  <dc:creator>Brian Tarran (with Anna Britten)</dc:creator>
  <link>https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/interviews/posts/2024/01/15/census-bureau.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>A month ago now, Real World Data Science published <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/interviews/posts/2023/12/15/ian-diamond.html">an interview with UK national statistician Professor Sir Ian Diamond</a>. In the process of preparing the text of that interview for publication, I found myself reflecting on a conversation I’d been part of earlier in the year with Robert Santos, director of the US Census Bureau.</p>
<p>I met Santos in Toronto, Canada, in August – a few hours before his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmljZLfqIbI">President’s Invited Address at the 2023 Joint Statistical Meetings</a>. The meeting was arranged as a joint interview with Anna Britten, editor of our sister publication <em>Significance</em> magazine, and Santos was joined by Sallie Ann Keller, the Census Bureau’s chief scientist and associate director for research and methodology, and Michael Hawes, senior advisor for data access and privacy.</p>
<div class="quarto-video ratio ratio-16x9"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SmljZLfqIbI?si=QEAN6QpbTlwPs20" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>The interview with Santos, Keller, and Hawes was published in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jrssig/article/20/5/40/7296065">the October issue of <em>Significance</em></a>, so you may have already read it. But, following on from our Sir Ian Diamond interview, I thought it worth highlighting some of what Santos <em>et al.</em> had to say, particularly where key themes, challenges, and opportunities seem to resonate across both the US Census Bureau and the UK Office for National Statistics.</p>
<p>I’ve also gone back to the original interview recording to pick out some previously unpublished comments.</p>

<p><strong>Robert Santos:</strong> Certainly it was formidable – although I’m comforted in knowing, after a year and a half, that the career staff [of the Census Bureau] were well positioned to accept this challenge anyway, and were working on it. But the challenge was real. We had the pandemic. We had to, basically, not redesign but scramble and adapt to a really threatening situation where the entirety of the 2020 census was conducted before there was a vaccine, and when people didn’t know the nature of the beast. A huge chunk of this operation was conducted when society was shut down. And not only did the Census Bureau need to rethink, nimbly and quickly, how to do its operation, but so did all of the different community partners – which was really enlightening because we realised that, at the end of the day, we could not have completed this job alone. And now our position is that we cannot complete our mission without the external community. They’re the extra folks we need in order to understand better what the needs are, and therefore improve our methods and data and the relevance of what we’re doing.</p>
<p>So, we see our role now as having a continuous engagement with the entire country at all levels – be it elected officials, universities and professors and the research community, or data users like policy users and policy researchers, or local community organisations that are doing neighbourhood stuff. And so we’re actively working between censuses to engage them and show them the value of the data that we’ve collected – not just decennial [census data], but also our flagship American Community Survey and our Current Population Study and all the 130 other business, economic as well as household types of studies that we’re doing.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="on-the-need-to-transform-census-bureau-operations">On the need to transform Census Bureau operations</h3>
<p><strong>Robert Santos:</strong> We absolutely have to transform and modernise our operation, from what was historically this transactional survey type of data collection – where we go to somebody that’s randomly sampled and we say, “Please give me your information” – and realise the value of taking that information, blending it with existing data, administrative data, even third-party private sector data, into a huge data pool and linking it together, and that will create new data products that will serve the public in ways that we never imagined before. And we already have some great examples of that. So, that transformation process is an incredible priority that we have to do, regardless of what our funding situation is. If we don’t do that, we’re not going to be able to serve the public in the way that we need to.</p>

<p><strong>Robert Santos:</strong> There are a couple of things going on. One is that we’re obliged, because of our values of scientific integrity, objectivity, transparency, and independence, to let folks know what we’re doing in terms of our use of administrative records, and we’ve done that and we will continue doing that. The big lift was really in preparing for the last decennial [census], where we took the use of administrative records to new heights in terms of their utility – not only to help us for some enumeration of households, but, more importantly, to help us predict which households were occupied or not, or to predict which households would benefit from the use of administrative record enumeration versus which ones wouldn’t, or how many times should we knock on the door before we do something else. And now, with that knowledge, we’re looking back at 2020 and saying, what worked? What didn’t? How can we exploit it? And we’re kind of moving the dial to say, “What can we take more advantage of for 2030?”, with full recognition that there were some subpopulations, there’s some segments of society, that we really need to focus and hone in on to make sure we get a good count.</p>

<p>We absolutely have to transform and modernise our operation, and realise the value of taking [survey] information, blending it with existing data, administrative data, even third-party private sector data, into a huge data pool and linking it together, and that will create new data products that will serve the public in ways that we never imagined before.</p>

<p><strong>Michael Hawes:</strong> Even though the decennial census is mandatory under law, we rely on voluntary participation. We’re relying on people being willing to respond to their census. In the lead up to each census, we do an extensive survey of what are the attitudes or motivators that will encourage people to respond or to not respond. And one of the recurring themes in that is concerns about privacy, concerns about how their data can be used. So, in order to help encourage people who have those concerns – and this is a sizable percentage of the population – we do need to have strong messaging about how their data are protected, how they can only be used for statistical purposes, and so on. But that has to be in very easy-to-consume sound bites, because a lot of people don’t have a background in statistical disclosure control or even in the legal conceptions about what privacy is. So, that is a real challenge for us. How do we convey the fact that we are taking this very seriously, and that their data are protected, in a way that people can kind of internalise and respond to?</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="on-making-sure-statistics-serve-the-public-good-and-the-role-of-the-census-bureau-in-supporting-data-literacy">On making sure statistics serve the public good, and the role of the Census Bureau in supporting data literacy</h3>
<p><strong>Sallie Ann Keller:</strong> In the US over the last decade, there’s been a really large movement around data for the public good, data science for the public good, and it’s really focused at trying to engage researchers and scholars – and we’re talking about high school students, community college students, undergraduates, graduate students – trying to engage them with civic engagement around data and data insights. That’s happening all over the country – really trying to democratise data and bring it in service of the public good. And I think that’s very exciting.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Hawes:</strong> We have a whole programme called Statistics in Schools which is about taking census data and making it valuable to teachers in the classroom, and allowing students at various levels – from elementary school through high school – to be able to engage with the data and use it to inform their own learning, and to learn about their own communities. That is especially profound in the years around the actual census, because that also serves as a catalyst for getting households to respond. If the kids are using the census data within the classroom, then they go home and say, “Hey, have you filled out your census form?”</p>
<p><strong>Robert Santos:</strong> It’s really important to start young, but then there’s also folks who want to use the data who are adults. So, we have something called the Census Academy, where you can go on to YouTube and get tutorials that show you visually somebody trying to use census data. And the second thing we do is, we really have a strong commitment for creating easier platforms for folks to access and utilise various types of data produced by the Census Bureau. We’re creating these data visualisation tools that bring together the demographic data that we collect, the economic data that we collect, and visualise it down to the census tract level so that local communities can pull that up. And then finally, in terms of the public good, there’s also work that we’re doing with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on our community resilience estimates to create the same type of data visualisations that can show where the potential worrisome geographic spots are.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="on-the-opportunities-for-bringing-together-census-bureau-data-and-large-language-models">On the opportunities for bringing together Census Bureau data and large language models</h3>
<p><strong>Sallie Ann Keller:</strong> We’re not going to be in the business of building generative AI models. But what we want is the statistics that we put out, the data that we put out, to be picked up by these large language models – to be kind of an input into generative AI. So, we are focused on that in terms of really looking at the structure of how we’re disseminating statistics, and how we’re disseminating things like data tables. How harvestable are they for AI? What are the guardrails we should put around that? We’re looking at and considering issues on data integrity, because when questions are posed, we would like our official statistics to be answering those questions, not our statistics translated through three other parties. Data integrity is really a huge issue, because we don’t want false data and infiltration happening that gets branded as our statistics. I don’t know where we’ll take it all, but I think we’d also like to be incredibly creative here. So, let’s suppose you ask a question and some statistic comes back. Well, why not have that be an experience, so that not just a statistic comes back but maybe a question or two comes back, to try to assess the context that you’re really asking about, so that we can not only have our data coming to you, but we can have the right data coming to you?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Hawes:</strong> Even with some of our more traditional statistical data products, informing users of the limitations and the the uncertainty baked into a lot of those estimates has historically been a challenge – even for some more sophisticated users. The number of people who ignore margins of error on data tables, even in our data products, is not insubstantial. And so, when we get into an AI-driven data dissemination kind of framework, how can we use the flexibility of those platforms to not just provide the answers to the questions people are asking, but also to educate and inform about what the limitations of those answers are?</p>

  <title>‘I was pretty clear in my mind that we were into a no-going-back situation’</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>For many people, six months into a new job is about the time you start to feel fully on top of things. You’ve figured out how the organisation works and your place in it. You’ve met all of your colleagues and got to know your way around the office. The job makes sense, everything’s under control. But then, a pandemic hits! What do you do? What is going through your head?</p>
<p>That’s a question we put to Professor Sir Ian Diamond, UK national statistician, who was only six months into the job when Covid-19 upended everything. He said: “My overall sense at all times was one of, ‘What needs to be done? What role can we play in helping to do it? And how do we make sure that we are doing things at pace?’”</p>
<p>There was no “flapping,” he said, but there was a real risk of exhaustion. “I could see pretty quickly that this was going to be a marathon, not a sprint, and while we had a lot to do,” he explained, “the last thing on earth we needed was for people to start burning out.”</p>
<p>Almost four years have passed since that time, but the effects of the pandemic continue to be felt – not least within the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the organisation Sir Ian leads. The Covid experience helped shape his thinking about how the ONS would operate post-pandemic, as he explains in this interview.</p>
<p>When we spoke with Sir Ian, he was six months into a second term as national statistician. By the end of that term, in 2028, what kind of organisation will the ONS be? Read on to find out.</p>
<div class="keyline">
<hr>
</div>
<p><strong>What was your experience of the Covid pandemic, being only six months into the role of national statistician at the time?</strong><br>
It was all-consuming and required an enormous amount of focus. At the beginning of the pandemic, huge amounts of data were flying in every different direction. I felt we were in a data deluge, and we needed to move to [delivering] insight, and really working hard early on to change the agenda towards a situation where we were asking questions – really serious and sensible questions – and working out if we had the data, or how we answered those questions.</p>
<p><strong>On the whole, ONS and the Government Statistical Service were praised for the way they responded to Covid. Did the pandemic experience inform your thinking about how the statistical system should operate once we moved out of that crisis situation?</strong><br>
Yes, in a number of areas. One was that we should not be completely dependent on data collected traditionally. For example, as we went into the pandemic, our ways of calculating inflation were pretty much dependent on people with clipboards going into supermarkets and shops and writing down the prices of things. We already had a project which was starting to think long term of using scanner data. But actually, being able to pivot very quickly to using web scraping to get data was incredibly important. We were also able to use web scraping early on to understand the availability of various goods in what we might call “adaptive purchasing,” or some would call “stockpiling.” And so, identifying that there were new ways of doing things and new data sources, I was pretty clear in my mind that we were into a no-going-back situation.</p>
<p>The second thing we demonstrated was that we could set things up very agilely and very quickly. And one final thing that I thought we absolutely have to continue with all the time is improved communication. You may recall that there were press conferences every day [during the early part of the pandemic], and I think during the start of those press conferences, the graphs and the slides were not always as brilliant as I would want them to be. We embedded a team into the Government Communication Service to work on the slides, and I thought that team did a great job. Improving the communication of statistics was incredibly important, because one of the things to come out of this dreadful pandemic was that people across the country became more data literate, and more demanding of data, and more able to interpret data. That was a good thing which I wanted to make sure we continued.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of embedding the lessons or the learnings of the pandemic into the ONS going forward, how much of it is culture change? How much is about rethinking the systems and the processes?</strong><br>
Was it culture? Was it improved processes? Was it better methods? All of the above. As an organisation, our main role in life is to measure the economy and society, and if you take that as your starting point, and then you ask the question, “In your lifetime, has the economy ever stood still? Has society ever stood still?” In my lifetime, I would argue, no. Therefore, we have to be an organisation which is constantly changing in order to reflect what is going on in the economy and in society. We have to change how we do things, and to ask questions about whether there are better ways of doing things, and that, I think, has been a really important reflection for us over the period both during and since the pandemic. We’ve learned a lot about the use of, for example, reproducible analytic pipelines to really improve the quality of our data at large, to improve the quality of our processes, and to enable us to do things more efficiently and effectively. We’ve learned a lot about new data sources, and we’ve really built on the opportunities and the skills so that you can now link data to be able to address questions that I could only have dreamt of 20 years ago.</p>
<p>And so, I do think we have changed the culture, changed our techniques, and changed our data. But does that mean that we’ve metaphorically thrown away the baby with the bathwater? Absolutely not. What we have now are appropriate methodologies to answer appropriate questions. Do we still use qualitative data? A hundred percent, when it is necessary to do so. Do we still use surveys? Yes, we’ve got some of the best surveys in the world. But equally, we also use digital data, administrative data, and we use very modern techniques of analysing those data. And we use data science in its broadest sense as often as we can.</p>
<p>So, I do think it’s been a major change in what we do, and that will continue. But underlying it all is a total commitment to quality, a total commitment to making sure that we have the best data to answer the question that we are trying to answer, and that all the time we are using the best approach to answer the questions.</p>

<p>We have changed the culture, our techniques, and our data. What we have now are appropriate methodologies to answer appropriate questions. Do we still use qualitative data? A hundred percent, when it is necessary to do so. Do we still use surveys? Yes, we’ve got some of the best surveys in the world. But equally, we also use digital data, administrative data, and we use very modern techniques of analysing those data.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>As well as changing the culture and the processes within the ONS itself, has some of your work also been about trying to bring the user community with you? When I first started reporting on official statistics 20 years ago, there was a sense that users of the data valued consistency in methodology, because that meant they could go back and look at the time series. But now, with this emphasis on innovation and looking at different ways of producing insight from different sources of data, has there been a tension, if you like, between these two cultures?</strong><br>
That whole question of “we’ve always done it this way” against “we can now do it better” is a super important one. And the length of time series is also important. When we change the ways of doing things, we need to take our user community with us, and we do. At the same time, we also need a very strong narrative (a) about why what we are doing gives us better data, and (b) about what the changes in the time series mean. So, just this year, with regard to prices and inflation, we’ve been able to bring in much better data than we had previously on rail ticket prices by using electronic data. It’s really super exciting. But we didn’t just bring them in and say, “Hey, we’ve got this new way of doing train prices and we’re planning to do the same again next year with used car prices using electronic data!” What we do is we dual run, and we work with our prices advisory committee to ensure that we understand what the implications of this change are, and we understand how to communicate them. But, you’ve got to be measuring the economy in the very, very best way that you can. We should not shy away from improving what we do.</p>
<p><strong>To what extent can the changes in thinking, the changes of approach, be credited to the experimentation and innovation work that is coming out of the ONS Data Science Campus?</strong><br>
The Data Science Campus has been absolutely brilliant. But at the same time, innovation does not only take place in the Data Science Campus. What we’ve built is a culture of innovation right across the organisation. Is that culture of innovation driven by the Data Science Campus? Not so much driven, but certainly helped, and certainly in partnership, and the fact that it is there encourages that culture of innovation.</p>
<p>I do think it is important to recognise, as I say to my colleagues many times, that we are not a blue-sky research institute, we are a national statistics institute, and our job is to produce economic and social statistics. Therefore, we need to be in the business of not just research but research and development – and thinking through how the research on new data that we do will enable improved economic measurement is, for us, incredibly exciting.</p>
<p>I’ll give you an example. We’ve [recently] signed a contract to get telephony data – a few years historically, and then regular data going forward. Now, this is entirely anonymised, but it will enable us to understand much more about, for example, commuting. It means that we will now need to do research on how to use those mobility data, and we’ll be really pushing that forward very quickly. But, at the same time, it’s not just about what can we do that’s interesting in this area; we need to have a very clear vision of what success looks like and the measurements, the economic measurements, that we are going to improve.</p>
<p><strong>How do you see that innovation mindset rolling out across government as a whole?</strong><br>
It’s worth saying two things. Firstly, my job is not only national statistician, I also have an extra couple of hats: one is head of the Government Analysis Function, and one is head of the Government Digital Service. I take those roles very seriously because I do think we need to propagate good practice and innovation right across government departments. It’s no use if it just sits in ONS.</p>
<p>We try really, really hard to have innovation meetings and innovation months, and I try to speak at as many as I’m invited to. And I think it is incredibly important that we really see ourselves – right across the Government Statistical Service, right across the Government Analysis Function – as seeking to propagate good practice.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned there about the Government Statistical Service and the Government Analysis Function. Is there scope one day for a Data Science Service within government?</strong><br>
The answer is yes. Under both the leadership of Laura Gilbert, who is head of 10 Downing Street’s data science, called 10DS, and Osama Rahman, who heads the Data Science Campus, we recently held a town hall for data scientists right across government to discuss, fundamentally, the question of what data scientists want from the analysis function, but equally [what they want] from a community of data scientists. Part of that is a question as to whether there should be, in government, a data science profession. I stress we haven’t come to the conclusion for that yet, but I would have to say it was a very successful town hall – many, many people attended, we had a really good discussion, and Laura and Osama will be taking forward that discussion over the next couple of months.</p>
<p><strong>You gave a keynote address at the RSS Conference in September, and one of the things you mentioned that I was particularly excited about was “Stat Chat.” I understand this is in the very early stages, and I have a very rudimentary understanding that it might well be a large language model trained on the ONS website and the data resources available, as a way to query the website. Can you tell me a bit more about the project?</strong><br>
We’re in private beta, and so there’s a whole set of agendas there. But we started it as a much better way to enable people to interrogate a pretty complex website with an enormous amount of data on, and to not only get to the datasets but to get to the existing metadata that are attached to them. What we wanted to do was to use open-source models, where the underlying data and the research behind them are made publicly available, so there’s nothing secret about this at the moment, and it’s very early stage. But we see the potential, as we move forward, as being able to really make it much easier for people to interrogate the data that we own and the data that we have published. If we can actually use large language models to enable people to be able to ask questions and then to get an authoritative answer from publicly available data, that seems to me to be a good place to be.</p>
<p><strong>I imagine, though, that when you’re dealing with something like national statistics, you need to be very alive to the danger of <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/editors-blog/posts/2022/11/23/LLM-content-warning.html#qa">the hallucination problem in large language models</a>; that if you’re querying something, it doesn’t throw up an invented statistic?</strong><br>
I couldn’t agree more. And that’s why we’re in private beta, working very hard to make sure that (a) it is working properly, (b) that it’s got the right security around it, and (c) that it is actually really useful.</p>
<p><strong>The hallucination issue in LLMs leads us onto the topic of trust in information, and obviously the ONS is very keen to ensure that there is trust in official statistics and in the data that is produced. This is a wider problem than anything the ONS can hope to address by itself, but what are the kinds of conversations you’re having internally about distrust in official sources of information?</strong><br>
This is something I say to my colleagues a lot: We should not expect people to trust us. We have to demonstrate to people that we are trustworthy. That’s incredibly important. A lot of it is about transparency. A lot of it is about absolute openness, showing your working, explaining where your data came from, and explaining your motivation for doing something. People say to me, “You might write a really strong methodological piece, but not many people read it.” Yes, but it’s there. And I’m a huge believer in research integrity, and in open data, and enabling data to be available for secondary analysis. And I think the more you are transparent, the more you work with people, the better.</p>
<p>A critical part, also, of demonstrating that you are trustworthy is engaging with the public. And that’s not telling the public; it’s engaging with the public. We put a lot of time into working with the public to say, “Well, what if we did this? What if we did that?” and getting their input. I don’t have any kind of switch to make people feel that we are trustworthy. It’s a continuous process of transparency and openness, where people feel that they have everything they need [to know] about what we do and about our data.</p>
<p>We also are absolutely passionate about explaining uncertainty. Don’t tell me the answer is 62% – the answer has some uncertainty about it, and we need to really think about how we display that uncertainty. And I have to say, I think some of the techniques now to display uncertainty are just so beautiful – unbelievably beautiful – and we need to do that, not in a gimmicky way, but in a way that really explains the uncertainty in any data that we present.</p>
<p><strong>Final question: by the end of your second term as national statistician, where do you think ONS will be as an organisation?</strong><br>
I hope it will be an innovative, agile organisation which is using evermore diverse types of information, but doing so in a transparent and open and rigorous way to improve economic and social statistics which can impact positively on the lives of our fellow citizens.</p>

<p>When you think about data visualisation in R <span class="citation" data-cites="R-base">(R Core Team 2022)</span>, you’d be forgiven for not jumping straight to thinking about creating Christmas cards. However, the package and functions we often use to create bar charts and line graphs can be repurposed to create festive images. This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to creating a Christmas card featuring a snowman – entirely in R. Though this seems like just a fun exercise, the functions and techniques you learn in this tutorial can also transfer into more traditional data visualisations created using {ggplot2} <span class="citation" data-cites="ggplot2">(Wickham 2016)</span> in R.</p>
<p>The code in this tutorial relies on the following packages:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lets-build-a-snowman">Let’s build a snowman!</h2>
<p>Before we jump in to writing R code, let’s take a step back and think about what you actually need to build a snowman. If you were given some crayons and a piece of paper, what would you draw?</p>
<p>You might draw two or three circles to make up the head and body. Perhaps some smaller dots for buttons and eyes, and a (rudimentary) hat constructed from some rectangles. Some brown lines create sticks for arms and, of course, a triangle to represent a carrot for a nose. For the background elements of our Christmas card, we also need the night sky (or day if you prefer), a light dusting of snow covering the ground, and a few snowflakes falling from the sky.</p>
<p>Now lines, rectangles, circles, and triangles are all just simple geometric objects. Crucially, they’re all things that we can create with {ggplot2} in R.</p>
</section>
<section id="build-a-snowman-with-r" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="build-a-snowman-with-r">Build a snowman with R</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the background. The easiest way to start with a blank canvas in {ggplot2} is to create an empty plot using <code>ggplot()</code> with no arguments. We can also remove all theme elements (such as the grey background and grid lines) with <code>theme_void()</code>. To change the background colour to a dark blue for the night sky, we can edit the <code>plot.background</code> element of the theme using <code>element_rect()</code> (since the background is essentially just a big rectangle).</p>
<p>In {ggplot2} <code>fill</code> is the inner colour of shapes whilst <code>colour</code> is the outline colour. You can specify colours in different ways in R: either via the <code>rgb()</code> function, using a character string for a hex colour such as <code>"#000000"</code>, or using a named colour. If you run <code>colors()</code>, you’ll see all the valid named colours you can use. Here, we’ve picked <code>"midnightblue"</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s save this initial plot as an object <code>s1</code> that we’ll keep adding layers to. Saving plots in different stages of styling as objects can help to keep your code more modular.</p>

<p>Next we’ll add some snow on the ground. We’ll do this by drawing a white rectangle along the bottom of the plot. There are two different functions that we could use to add a rectangle: <code>geom_rect()</code> or <code>annotate()</code>. The difference between the two is that <code>geom_rect()</code> maps columns of a <code>data.frame</code> to different elements of a plot whereas <code>annotate()</code> can take values passed in as vectors. Most of the {ggplot2} graphs you’ll see will use <code>geom_*()</code> functions. However, if you’re only adding one or two elements to a plot then <code>annotate()</code> might be quicker.</p>
<p>Since we’re only adding one rectangle for the snow, it’s easier to use <code>annotate()</code> with the <code>"rect"</code> geometry. This requires four arguments: the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the rectangle – essentially specifying where the corners are. We can also change the colour of the rectangle and its outline using the <code>fill</code> and <code>colour</code> arguments. Here, I’ve used a very light grey instead of white.</p>
<p>If we don’t set the axis limits using <code>xlim()</code> and <code>ylim()</code>, the plot area will resize to fit the area of the snow rectangle. The night sky background will disappear. You can choose any axis limits you wish here – but the unit square will make it easier to find the right coordinates when deciding where to position other elements. Finally, we add <code>coord_fixed()</code> to fix the 1:1 aspect ratio and make sure our grid is actually square with <code>expand = FALSE</code> to remove the additional padding at the sides of the plot.</p>

<p>To finish off the background, we’ll add some falling snowflakes. We first need to decide where on the plot the snowflakes will appear. We’ll be plotting lots of snowflakes, so manually typing out the coordinates of where they’ll be would be very inefficient. Instead, we can use functions to generate the locations randomly. For this we’ll use the uniform distribution. The uniform distribution has two parameters – the lower and upper bounds where any values between the bounds are equally likely. You can generate samples from a uniform distribution in R using the <code>runif()</code> function.</p>
<p>When generating random numbers in R (or any other programming language), it’s important to set a seed. This means that if you give your code to someone else, they’ll get the same random numbers as you. Some people choose to use the date as the random seed and since we’re making Christmas cards, we’ll use Christmas day as the random seed – in <code>yyyymmdd</code> format, of course!</p>
<p>We create a variable <code>n</code> specifying how many snowflakes we’ll create. Creating a variable rather than hard coding the variables makes it easier to vary how many snowflakes we want. Since our plot grid goes between 0 and 1 in both the x and y directions, we generate random numbers between 0 and 1 for both the x and y coordinates and store the values in a <code>data.frame</code> called <code>snowflakes</code>.</p>

<p>Now we can plot the <code>snowflakes</code> data using <code>geom_point()</code> – the same function you’d use for a scatter plot. Since we’re using a <code>geom_*()</code> function, we need to tell {ggplot2} which columns go on the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> axes inside the <code>aes()</code> function. To plot the snowflakes, we’re going to make using of R’s different point characters. The default when plotting with <code>geom_point()</code> is a small black dot, but we can choose to use a small star (close enough to a snowflake!) by setting <code>pch = 8</code> and changing the <code>colour</code> to <code>"white"</code>.</p>

<p>Now comes the part where we start rolling up some snowballs! Or, in the case of an R snowman, we draw some circles. Unfortunately, there isn’t a built-in <code>geom_*()</code> function in {ggplot2} for plotting circles. We could use <code>geom_point()</code> here and increase the size of the points but this approach can look a little bit <em>fuzzy</em> when the points are very large. Instead, we’ll turn to a {ggplot2} extension package for some additional <code>geom_*</code> functions - {ggforce} <span class="citation" data-cites="ggforce">(Pedersen 2022)</span>.</p>
<p>The <code>geom_circle()</code> function requires at least three elements mapped to the aesthetics inside <code>aes()</code>: the coordinates of the centre of the circle given by <code>x0</code> and <code>y0</code>, and the radii of each of the circles, <code>r</code>. Instead of creating a separate data frame and passing it into <code>geom_circle()</code>, we can alternatively create the data frame inside the function. The <code>fill</code> and <code>colour</code> arguments work as they do in {ggplot2} and we can set both to <code>"white"</code>.</p>

<p>We can use <code>geom_point()</code> again to add some more points to represent the buttons and the eyes. Here, we’ll manually specify the coordinates of the points. For the buttons we add them in a vertical line in the middle of the snowman’s body circle, and for the eyes we add them in a horizontal line in the middle of the head circle.</p>
<p>Since no two rocks are exactly the same size, we can add some random variation to the size of the points using <code>runif()</code> again. We generate five different sizes between 2 and 4.5. For reference, the default point size is 1.5. Adding <code>scale_size_identity()</code> means that the sizes of the points are actually equally to the sizes we generated from <code>runif()</code> and removes the legend that is automatically added when we add <code>size</code> inside <code>aes()</code>.</p>

<p>To add sticks for arms, we can make use of <code>geom_segment()</code> to draw some lines. We could also use <code>geom_path()</code> but that is designed to connect points across multiple cases, whereas <code>geom_segment()</code> draws a single line per row of data – and we don’t want to join the snowman’s arms together!</p>
<p>To use <code>geom_segment()</code> we need to create a data frame containing the x and y coordinates for the start and end of each line, and then pass this into the aesthetic mapping with <code>aes()</code>. We can control the colour and width of the lines using the <code>colour</code> and <code>linewidth</code> arguments. Setting the <code>lineend</code> argument to <code>"round"</code> means that the ends of the lines will be rounded rather than the default straight edge.</p>

<p>We’ll now add a (very simple) hat to our snowman, fashioned out of two rectangles. We can add the rectangles as we did before using the <code>annotate()</code> function and specifying the locations of the corners of the rectangles. We start with a shorter wider rectangle for the brim of the hat, and then a taller, narrower rectangle for the crown of the hat. Since we’ll colour them both <code>"brown"</code>, it doesn’t matter if they overlap a little bit.</p>
<p>This <em>might</em> be one of the situations we should have used <code>geom_rect()</code> instead of <code>annotate()</code> but it might take a lot of trial and error to position the hat exactly where we want it, and this seemed a little easier with <code>annotate()</code>.</p>

<p>Now we can move on to the final component of building a snowman – the carrot for his nose! We’re going to use a triangle for the nose. Unfortunately, there are no built-in triangle geoms in {ggplot2} so we’ll have to make our own. There are different ways to do this, but here we’re going to make use of the {sf} package <span class="citation" data-cites="sf">(Pebesma 2018)</span>. The {sf} package (short for <em>simple features</em>) is designed for working with spatial data. Although we’re not working with maps, we can still use {sf} to make shapes – including polygons.</p>
<p>We start by constructing a matrix with two columns – one for x coordinates and one for y. The x coordinates start in the middle of the head and go slightly to the right for the triangle point. The y coordinates take a little bit more trial and error to get right. Note that although triangles only have three corners, we have four rows of points. The last row must be the same as the first to make the polygon <em>closed</em>. The matrix is then converted into a spatial object using the <code>st_polygon()</code> function, and we can check how it looks using <code>plot()</code>.</p>

<p>We can plot <code>sf</code> objects with {ggplot2} using <code>geom_sf()</code>. <code>geom_sf()</code> is a slightly special <code>geom</code> since we don’t need to specify an aesthetic mapping for the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> axes – they are determined automatically from the <code>sf</code> object along with which type of geometry to draw. If your <code>sf</code> object has points, points will be drawn. If it has country shapes, polygons will be drawn. Like other <code>geom_*()</code> functions, we can change the <code>colour</code> and <code>fill</code> arguments to a different colour – in this case <code>"orange"</code> to represent a carrot!</p>
<p>You should see a <code>Coordinate system already present. Adding new coordinate system, which will replace the existing one.</code> message when you run the following code. The is because <code>geom_sf</code> forces it’s own coordinate system on the plot overriding our previous code specifying <code>coord_fixed()</code>. If you run it without the <code>coord_sf(expand = FALSE)</code>, the extra space around the plot will reappear. We can remove it again with <code>expand = FALSE</code>.</p>

When adding text, we require at least three arguments: the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates of where the text should be added, and the <code>label</code> denoting what text should appear. We can supply additional arguments to <code>annotate()</code> to style the text, such as: <code>colour</code> (which changes the colour of the text); <code>family</code> (to define which font to use); <code>fontface</code> (which determines if the font is bold or italic, for example); and <code>size</code> (which changes the size of the text). The <code>"mono"</code> option for <code>family</code> tells {ggplot2} to use the default system monospace font.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sending-christmas-cards-in-r">Sending Christmas cards in R</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve finished creating our Christmas card, we need to think about how to send it. You could save it as an image file using <code>ggsave()</code>, print it out, and send it in the post. Or you could also use R to send it!</p>
<p>There are many different R packages for sending emails from R. If you create a database of email addresses and names, you could personalise the message on the Christmas card and then send it automatically as an email from R. If you want to automate the process of sending physical cards from R, you might be interested in the <a href="https://github.com/jnolis">{ggirl} package</a> from Jacqueline Nolis <span class="citation" data-cites="ggirl">(Nolis 2023)</span>. {ggirl} allows you to send postcards with a <code>ggplot</code> object printed on the front. {ggirl} is also an incredible example of <a href="https://jnolis.com/blog/introducing_ggirl/">an eCommerce platform built with R</a>! Note that {ggirl} can currently only send physical items to addresses in the United States.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="other-christmas-r-packages">Other Christmas R packages</h2>
<p>If you’re curious about making Christmas cards with R but you don’t have the time to make them from scratch, you’ll likely find the <code>christmas</code> R package <span class="citation" data-cites="christmas">(Barrera-Gomez 2022)</span> helpful. This package from Jose Barrera-Gomez can generate lots of different Christmas cards, many of them animated and available in different languages (English, Catalan and Spanish).</p>
<p>Emil Hvitfeldt has also created a <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a> <a href="https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/quarto-snow">extension that gives the effect of falling snowflakes</a> on HTML outputs – including revealjs slides which is perfect for festive presentations!</p>
<p>Have you made your own Christmas cards with R? We’d love to see your designs!</p>

  <title>A Christmas card in R for the Real World Data Science community</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>A few weeks back, I managed to catch Nicola Rennie’s presentation to the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/oxford-r-user-group/events/297417319/">Oxford R User Group on how to create Christmas cards in R</a>. It was a fun session, and thanks to Nicola’s clear and concise explanations, I felt emboldened to attempt my own design, using her code as a base.</p>
<p>If you missed the Meetup session, Nicola has kindly written <a href="../../../../../../ideas/tutorials/posts/2023/12/12/xmas-cards.html">a tutorial for Real World Data Science</a> that walks through all the necessary steps to create a snowman against a snowy night’s sky. You’ll want to read that tutorial first before returning to this blog.</p>
<p>My design uses the same basic setting as Nicola’s but updates the scene to reflect the Real World Data Science (RWDS) brand colours, and I replace the snowman with a Christmas tree adorned with coloured baubles.</p>
<section id="snowy-sky" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="snowy-sky">Snowy sky</h2>
<p>We begin by loading in the following packages, adding a couple extra to the ones Nicola uses:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

<span id="cb1-5"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">library</span>(patchwork) </span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then we add the sky, now recoloured in RWDS purple using <code>fill</code> and <code>color</code>:</p>

<span id="cb2-6">s1</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We use the same code as Nicola to create the snowflakes, but we do this step first before adding snow on the ground, as we’re using the RWDS site background colour, hex code <code>#f0eeb</code>, to represent our settled snow:</p>

<p>To build her snowman, Nicola created a series of circles that were stacked and overlaid. A simple Christmas tree, though, requires a series of triangles. So, taking Nicola’s snowman’s nose (also a triangle) as our starting point, we coded three sets of coordinates – <code>tree_pts1</code>, <code>tree_pts2</code>, and <code>tree_pts3</code> – for three triangles of decreasing size that would sit on top of one another.</p>

  <title>AI and digital ethics in 2023: a ‘remarkable, eventful year’</title>
  <dc:creator>Brian Tarran</dc:creator>
  <link>https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/editors-blog/posts/2023/12/08/digital-ethics-summit.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>What a difference a year makes! That was the general tone of the conversation coming out of techUK’s <a href="https://www.techuk.org/digital-ethics-summit-2023-seizing-the-moment.html">Digital Ethics Summit</a> this week. At last year’s event, ChatGPT was but a few days old. An exciting, enticing prospect, sure – but not yet the phenomenon it would soon become. My notes from last year include only two mentions of the AI chatbot: Andrew Strait of the Ada Lovelace Institute expressing concern about the way ChatGPT had been released straight to the public, and Jack Stilgoe of UCL warning of the threat such technology poses to the social contract – public data trains it, while private firms profit.</p>
<p>A lot has happened since last December, as many of the speakers at Wednesday’s summit pointed out. UNESCO’s Gabriela Ramos commented on how <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-programme">the UK’s AI Safety Summit</a>, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/">US President Joe Biden’s executive order on AI</a>, and other international initiatives had brought about “a change in the conversation” on AI risk, safety, and assurance. Simon Staffell of Microsoft spoke of “a huge amount of progress” being made, building from principles into voluntary actions that companies and countries can take.</p>
<p>Luciano Floridi of Yale University described 2023 as a “remarkable, eventful year which we didn’t quite expect,” with various international efforts helping to build consensus on what needs to be done, and what needs to be regulated, to ensure the benefits of AI can be realised while harms are minimised. Camille Ford of the Centre for European Policy Studies noted that while attempts at global governance of AI make for a “crowded space” – with more than 200 documents in circulation – there are at least principles in common across the various initiatives, focusing on aspects such as transparency, reliability and trustworthiness, safety, privacy, and accountability and liability.</p>
<p>However, in some respects, we’ve not come as far as we could or should have over the past 12 months. Ford, for instance, called for more conversation on AI safety, and a frank discussion about on whose terms AI safety is defined. Not only are there the risks and harms of AI outputs to consider, but also environmental harms, exploitative labour practices, and more besides. <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/posts/2023/12/06/ai-fringe.html">Echoing the Royal Statistical Society’s recent AI debate</a>, Ford said we need to focus on the risks we face now, rather than being consumed by discussions about the existential and catastrophic risks of AI – which, for many, are still firmly in the realm of science fiction.</p>
<p>There also remains “a big mismatch” between the AI knowledge and skills that reside within tech companies and that of other communities, said Zeynep Engin of Data for Policy. And many speakers were clear that the global south needs a more prominent voice in the AI debate.</p>
<section id="regulatory-approaches" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="regulatory-approaches">Regulatory approaches</h2>
<p>The UK government’s AI Safety Summit has been criticised for focusing too much on the hypothetical existential risks of AI. But, on regulation at least, there was broad agreement that the UK’s principles- and sector-based approach, outlined in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-regulation-a-pro-innovation-approach/white-paper">a March 2023 white paper</a>, is the right one. That’s not to say it’s perfect: discussions were had about whether regulatory bodies would be adequately funded to regulate the use of AI in their sectors, while Hetan Shah of the British Academy wondered “where was the golden thread” linking the AI white paper to the AI Safety Summit and its various pronouncements, including <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-launches-new-ai-safety-institute">plans for an AI Safety Institute</a>. (On the Safety Institute in particular, Lord Tim Clement-Jones was sceptical of yet another body being drafted in to debate these issues – a point made by panellists at the RSS’s recent AI debate.)</p>
<p>Delegates also got to hear from the UK’s Information Commissioner directly. John Edwards delivered a keynote address in which he acknowledged the huge excitement surrounding the benefits AI promises to bring, while cautioning that deployment and use of AI must be done in accordance with existing rules on data protection and privacy. The technology may be new, he said, but the same old data rules apply: “Our legislation is founded on technology-neutral principles of general application. They are capable of adapting to numerous new technologies, as they have over the last 30 years and will continue to do.”</p>
<p>He warned that noncompliance with data protection rules and regulations “will not be profitable,” and that persistent misuse of AI and personal data for competitive advantage would be punished. Edwards concluded by saying that AI is built on the data of human individuals and should therefore be used to improve their lives, and not put them or their personal data at risk.</p>

<section id="elections-in-an-era-of-generative-ai" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="elections-in-an-era-of-generative-ai">Elections in an era of generative AI</h2>
<p>One major looming risk is the use of generative AI to create mis- and disinformation during election campaigns. Hans-Petter Dalen of IBM suggested that next year is perhaps the biggest year for elections in the history of mankind, with votes due in the UK, US, and India, to name but a few. Generative AI represents not a new threat, he said, but an “amplified” one – a point further developed by Henry Parker of Logically.ai. Parker spoke of the risk of large-scale breakdown in trust due to mis- or disinformation campaigns. Thanks to AI tools, he said, we are now seeing the “democratisation of disinformation.” What once might have cost millions of dollars and required a team of hundreds of people can now be done much more cheaply and with fewer human resources. As the Royal Society’s Areeq Chowdhury said, the challenge of disinformation has only become harder.</p>
<p>Asked how to counter this, Dalen said that if he were a politician, “I would certainly get my own blockchain and all my content would have been digitally watermarked from source – that’s what the blockchain does.” But digital watermarking is only part of the answer, added Parker. Identifying mis- and disinformation is both a question of provenance and of dissemination. Logically.ai is using AI as a tool to analyse behaviours around the circulation of mis- and disinformation, Parker said – positioning AI as but one solution to a problem it has helped exacerbate.</p>

  <title>Evaluating artificial intelligence: How data science and statistics can make sense of AI models</title>
  <dc:creator>Brian Tarran</dc:creator>
  <link>https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/posts/2023/12/06/ai-fringe.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>A little over a month ago, governments, technology firms, multilateral organisations, and academic and civil society groups came together at Bletchley Park – home of Britain’s World War II code breakers – to discuss the safety and risks of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>One output from that event was <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-2023-the-bletchley-declaration/the-bletchley-declaration-by-countries-attending-the-ai-safety-summit-1-2-november-2023">a declaration</a>, signed by countries in attendance, of their resolve to “work together in an inclusive manner to ensure human-centric, trustworthy and responsible AI that is safe, and supports the good of all.”</p>
<p>We also heard from UK prime minister Rishi Sunak of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-launches-new-ai-safety-institute">plans for an AI Safety Institute</a>, to be based in the UK, which will “carefully test new types of frontier AI before and after they are released to address the potentially harmful capabilities of AI models, including exploring all the risks, from social harms like bias and misinformation, to the most unlikely but extreme risk, such as humanity losing control of AI completely.”</p>
<p>But at a panel debate at the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) the day before the Bletchley Park gathering, data scientists, statisticians, and machine learning experts questioned whether such an institute would be sufficient to meet the challenges posed by AI; whether data inputs – compared to AI model outputs – are getting the attention they deserve; and whether the summit was overly focused on <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/posts/2023/06/05/no-AI-probably-wont-kill-us.html">AI doomerism</a> and neglecting more immediate risks and harms. There were also calls for AI developers to be more driven to solve real-world problems, rather than just pursuing AI for AI’s sake.</p>
<p>The RSS event was chaired by Andrew Garrett, the Society’s president, and formed part of the national <a href="https://aifringe.org/">AI Fringe programme of activities</a>. The panel featured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mihaela van der Schaar, John Humphrey Plummer professor of machine learning, artificial intelligence and medicine at the University of Cambridge and a fellow at The Alan Turing Institute.</li>
<li>Detlef Nauck, head of AI and data science research at BT, and a member of the <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/editors-blog/posts/2022/10/18/meet-the-team.html">Real World Data Science editorial board</a>.</li>
<li>Mark Levene, principal scientist in the Department of Data Science at the National Physical Laboratory.</li>
<li>Martin Goodson, chief executive of Evolution AI, and former chair of the RSS Data Science and AI Section.</li>
</ul>
<p>What follows are some edited highlights and key takeaways from the discussion.</p>
<div class="keyline">

<section id="ai-safety-and-ai-risks" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ai-safety-and-ai-risks">AI safety, and AI risks</h2>
<p><strong>Andrew Garrett:</strong> For those who were listening to the commentary last week, the PM [prime minister] made a very interesting speech. Rishi Sunak announced the creation of the world’s first AI Safety Institute in the UK, to examine, evaluate and test new types of AI. He also stated that he pushed hard to agree the first ever international statement about the risks of AI because, in his view, there wasn’t a shared understanding of the risks that we face. He used the example of the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to establish a truly global panel to publish a “state of AI science” report. And he also announced an investment in raw computing power, so around a billion pounds in a supercomputer, and £2.5 billion in quantum computers, making them available for researchers and businesses as well as government.</p>
<p>The RSS provided two responses this year to prominent [AI policy] reviews. The first was in June <a href="https://rss.org.uk/RSS/media/File-library/Policy/2023/RSS-AI-white-paper-response-v2-2.pdf">on the AI white paper</a>, and the second was on <a href="https://rss.org.uk/RSS/media/File-library/Policy/RSS_Evidence_Communications_and_Digital_Lords_Select_Committee_Inquiry_Large_Language_Models_September_2023.pdf">the House of Lords Select Committee inquiry into large language models</a> back in September. How do they relate to what the PM said? There’s some good news here, and maybe not quite so good news.</p>
<p>First, the RSS had requested investments in AI evaluation and a risk-based approach. And you could argue, by stating that there will be a safety institute, that that certainly ticks one of the boxes. We also recommended investment in open source, in computing power, and in data access. In terms of computing power, that was certainly in the [PM’s] speech. We spoke about strengthening leadership, and in particular including practitioners in the [AI safety] debate. A lot of academics and maybe a lot of the big tech companies have been involved in the debate, but we want to get practitioners – those close to the coalface – involved in the debate. I’m not sure we’ve seen too much of that. We recommended that strategic direction was provided, because it’s such a fast-moving area, and the fact that the Bletchley Park Summit is happening tomorrow, I think, is good for that. And we also recommended that data science capability was built amongst the regulators. I don’t think there was any mention of that.</p>
<p>That’s the context [for the RSS event today]. What I’m going to do now is ask each of the panellists to give an introductory statement around the AI summit, focusing on the safety aspects. What do they see as the biggest risk? And how would they mitigate or manage this risk?</p>
<p><strong>Detlef Nauck:</strong> I work at BT and run the AI and data science research programme. We’ve been looking at the safety, reliability, and responsibility of AI for quite a number of years already. Five years ago, we put up a responsible AI framework in the company, and this is now very much tied into our data governance and risk management frameworks.</p>
<p>Looking at the AI summit, they’re focusing on what they call “frontier models,” and they’re missing a trick here because I don’t think we need to worry about all-powerful AI; we need to worry about inadequate AI that is being used in the wrong context. For me, AI is programming with data, and that means I need to know what sort of data has been used to build the model, and I need AI vendors to be upfront about it and to tell me: What is the data that they have used to build it, how have they built it, or if they’ve tested for bias? And there are no protocols around this. So, therefore, I’m very much in favour of AI evaluation. But I don’t want to wait for an institute for AI evaluation. I want the academic research that needs to be done around this, which hasn’t been done. I want everybody who builds AI systems to take this responsibility and document properly what they’re doing.</p>

<p>I hear more and more a lot of companies talking about AI general intelligence, and how AI is going to take over the world, and I’m tremendously concerned about this. There is an opportunity to build AI that is human empowering, that keeps us strong, able, capable, intelligent, and can support us in all our human capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Mihaela van der Schaar:</strong> I am an AI researcher building AI and machine learning technology. Before talking about the risks, I also would like to say that I see tremendous potential for good. Many of these machine learning AI models can transform for the better areas that I find extremely important – healthcare and education. That being said, there are substantial risks, and we need to be very careful about that. First, if not designed well, AI can be both unsafe as well as biased, and that could lead to tremendous impact, especially in medicine and education. I completely agree with all the points that the Royal Statistical Society has made not only about open source but also about data access. This AI technology cannot be built unless you have access to high quality data, and what I see a lot happening, especially in industry, is people have data sources that they’ll keep private, build second-rate or third-rate technology on them, and then turn that into commercialised products that are sold to us for a lot of money. If data is made widely available, the best as well as the safest AI can be produced, rather than monopolised.</p>
<p>Another area of risk that I’m especially worried about is human marginalisation. I hear more and more a lot of companies talking about AI general intelligence, and how AI is going to take over the world, and I’m tremendously concerned as an AI researcher about this. There is an opportunity to build AI that is human empowering, that keeps us strong, able, capable, intelligent, and can support us in all our human capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Goodson:</strong> The AI Safety Summit is starting tomorrow. But, unfortunately, I think the government are focusing on the wrong risks. There are lots of risks to do with AI, and if you look at the scoping document for the summit, it says that what they’re interested in is misuse risk and the risk of loss of control. Misuse risk is that bad actors will gain access to information that they shouldn’t have and build chemical weapons and things like that. And the loss of control risk is that we will have this super intelligence which is going to take over and we should see, as is actually mentioned, the risk of the extinction of the human race, which I think is a bit overblown.</p>
<p>Both of these risks – the misuse risk and the loss of control risk – are potential risks. But we don’t really know how likely they are. We don’t even know whether they’re possible. But there are lots of risks that we do know are possible, like loss of jobs, and reductions in salary, particularly of white-collar jobs – that seems inevitable. There’s another risk, which is really important, which is the risk of monopolistic control by the small number of very powerful AI companies. These are the risks which are not just likely but are actually happening now – people are losing their jobs right now because of AI – and in terms of monopolistic control, OpenAI is the only company that has anything like a large language model as powerful as GPT-4. Even the mighty Google can’t really compete. This is a huge risk, I think, because we have no control over pricing: they could raise the prices if they wanted to; they could constrain access; they could only give access to certain people that they want to give access to. We don’t have any control over these systems.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Levene:</strong> I work in NPL as a principal scientist in the data science department. I’m also emeritus professor in Birkbeck, University of London. I have a long-standing expertise in machine learning and focus in NPL on trustworthy AI and uncertainty quantification. I believe that measurement is a key component in locking-in AI safety. Trustworthy AI and safe AI both have similar goals but different emphases. We strive to demonstrate the trustworthiness of an AI system so that we can have confidence in the technology making what we perceive as responsible decisions. Safe AI puts the emphasis on the prevention of harmful consequences. The risk [of AI] is significant, and it could potentially be catastrophic if we think of nuclear power plants, or weapons, and so on. I think one of the problems here is, who is actually going to take responsibility? This is a big issue, and not necessarily an issue for the scientist to decide. Also, who is accountable? For instance, the developers of large language models: are they the ones that are accountable? Or is it the people who deploy the large language models and are fine-tuning them for their use cases?</p>
<p>The other thing I want to emphasise is the socio-technical characteristics [of the AI problem]. We need to get an interdisciplinary team of people to actually try and tackle these issues.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-we-need-an-ai-safety-institute">Do we need an AI Safety Institute?</h2>
<p><strong>Andrew Garrett:</strong> Do we need to have an AI Safety Institute, as Rishi Sunak has said? And if we don’t need one, why not?</p>
<p><strong>Detlef Nauck:</strong> I’m more in favour of encouraging academic research in the field and funding the kind of research projects that can look into how to build AI safely, [and] how to evaluate what it does. One of the key features of this technology is it has not come out of academic research; it has been built by large tech companies. And so, I think we have to do a bit of catch up in scientific research and in understanding how are we building these models, what can they do, and how do we control them?</p>
<p><strong>Mihaela van der Schaar:</strong> This technology has a life of its own now, and we are using it for all sorts of things that maybe initially was not even intended. So, shall we create an AI [safety] institute? We can, but we need to realise first that testing AI and showing that it’s safe in all sorts of ways is complicated. I would dare say that doing that well is a big research challenge by itself. I don’t think just one institute will solve it. And I feel the industry needs to bear some of the responsibility. I was very impressed by Professor [Geoffrey] Hinton, who came to Cambridge and said, “I think that some of these companies should invest as much money in making safe AI as developing AI.” I resonated quite a lot with that.</p>
<p>Also, let’s not forget, many academic researchers have two hats nowadays: they are professors, and they are working for big tech [companies] for a lot of money. So, if we take this academic, we put them in this AI tech safety institute, we have potential for corruption. I’m not saying that this will happen. But one needs to be very aware, and there needs to be a very big separation between who develops [AI technology] and who tests it. And finally, we need to realise that we may require an enormous amount of computation to be able to validate and test correctly, and very few academic or governmental organisations may have [that].</p>

<p>I think it’s an insult to the UK’s scientific legacy that we’re reduced to testing software that has been made by US companies. We have huge talents in this country. Why aren’t we using that talent to actually build something instead of testing something that someone else has made?</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Martin Goodson:</strong> Can I disagree with this idea of an evaluation institute? I think it’s a really, really bad idea, for two reasons. The first is an argument about fairness. If you look at drug regulation, who pays for clinical trials? It’s not the government. It’s the pharmaceutical companies. They spend billions on clinical trials. So, why do we want to do this testing for free for the big tech companies? We’re just doing product development for them. It’s insane! They should be paying to show that their products are safe.</p>
<p>The other reason is, I think it’s an insult to the UK’s scientific legacy that we’re reduced to testing software that has been made by US companies. I think it’s pathetic. We were one of the main leaders of the Human Genome Project, and we really pushed it – the Wellcome Trust and scientists in the UK pushed the Human Genome Project because we didn’t want companies to have monopolistic control over the human genome. People were idealistic, there was a moral purpose. But now, we’re so reduced that all we can do is test some APIs that have been produced by Silicon Valley companies. We have huge talents in this country. Why aren’t we using that talent to actually build something instead of testing something that someone else has made?</p>
<p><strong>Mark Levene:</strong> Personally, I don’t see any problem in having an AI institute for safety or any other AI institutes. I think what’s important in terms of taxpayers’ money is that whatever institute or forum is invested in, it’s inclusive. One thing that the government should do is, we should have a panel of experts, and this panel should be interdisciplinary. And what this panel can do is it can advise government of the state of play in AI, and advise the regulators. And this panel doesn’t have to be static, it doesn’t have to be the same people all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Garrett:</strong> To evaluate something, whichever way you chose to do it, you need to have an inventory of those systems. So, with the current proposal, how would this AI Safety Institute have an inventory of what anyone was doing? How would it even work in practice?</p>
<p><strong>Martin Goodson:</strong> Unless we voluntarily go to them and say, “Can you test out our stuff?” then they wouldn’t. That’s the third reason why it’s a terrible idea. You’d need a licencing regime, like for drugs. You’d need to licence AI systems. But teenagers in their bedrooms are creating AI systems, so that’s impossible.</p>

<section id="lets-do-reality-centric-ai" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lets-do-reality-centric-ai">Let’s do reality-centric AI!</h2>
<p><strong>Andrew Garrett:</strong> What are your thoughts about Rishi Sunak wanting the UK to be an AI powerhouse?</p>
<p><strong>Martin Goodson:</strong> It’s not going to be a powerhouse. This stuff about us being world leading in AI, it’s just a fiction. It’s a fairy tale. There are no real supercomputers in the UK. There are moves to build something, like you mentioned in your introduction, Andrew. But what are they going do with it? If they’re just going to build a supercomputer and carry on doing the same kinds of stuff that they’ve been doing for years, they’re not going to get anywhere. There needs to be a big project with an aim. You can build as many computers as you want. But if you haven’t got a plan for what to do with them, what’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>Mihaela van der Schaar:</strong> I really would agree with that. What about solving some real problem: trying to solve cancer; trying to solve our crisis in healthcare, where we don’t have enough infrastructure and doctors to take care of us? What about solving the climate change problem, or even traffic control, or preventing the next financial crisis? I wrote a little bit about that, and I call it “let’s do reality-centric AI.” Let’s have some goal that’s human empowering, take a problem that we have – energy, climate, cancer, Alzheimer’s, better education for children, and more diverse education for children – and let us solve these big challenges, and in the process we will build AI that’s hopefully more human empowering, rather than just saying, “Oh, we are going to solve everything if we have general AI.” Right now, I hear too much about AI for the sake of AI. I’m not sure, despite all the technology we build, that we have advanced in solving some real-world problems that are important for humanity – and imminently important.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Goodson:</strong> So, healthcare– I tried to make an appointment with my GP last week, and they couldn’t get me an appointment for four weeks. In the US you have this United States Medical Licencing Examination, and in order to practice medicine you need to pass all three components, you need to pass them by about 60%. They are really hard tests. GPT-4 for gets over 80% in all three of those. So, it’s perfectly plausible, I think, that an AI could do at least some of the role of the GP. But, you’re right, there is no mission to do that, there is no ambition to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Mihaela van der Schaar:</strong> Forget about replacing the doctors with ChatGPT, which I’m less sure is such a good idea. But, building AI to do the planning of healthcare, to say, “[Patient A], based on what we have found out about you, you’re not as high risk, maybe you can come in four weeks. But [patient B], you need to come tomorrow, because something is worrisome.”</p>
<p><strong>Martin Goodson:</strong> We can get into the details, but I think we are agreeing that a big mission to solve real problems would be a step forward, rather than worrying about these risks of superintelligences taking over everything, which is what the government is doing right now.</p>

<section id="managing-misinformation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="managing-misinformation">Managing misinformation</h2>
<p><strong>Andrew Garrett:</strong> We have some important elections coming up in 2024 and 2025. We haven’t talked much about misinformation, and then disinformation. So, I’m interested to get your views here. How much is that a problem?</p>
<p><strong>Detlef Nauck:</strong> There’s a problem in figuring out when it happens, and that’s something we need to get our heads around. One thing that we’re looking at is, how do we make communication safe from bad actors? How do you know that you’re talking to the person you see on the camera and it’s not a deep fake? Detection mechanisms don’t really work, and they can be circumvented. So, it seems like what we need is new standards for communication systems, like watermarks and encryption built into devices. A camera should be able to say, “I’ve produced this picture, and I have watermarked it and it’s encrypted to a certain level,” and if you don’t see that, you can’t trust that what you see comes from a genuine camera, and it’s not artificially created. It’s more difficult around text and language – you can’t really watermark text.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Levene:</strong> Misinformation is not just a derivative of AI. It’s a derivative of social networks and lots of other things.</p>
<p><strong>Mihaela van der Schaar:</strong> I would agree that this is not only a problem with AI. We need to emphasise the role of education, and lifelong education. This is key to being able to comprehend, to judge for ourselves, to be trained to judge for ourselves. And maybe we need to teach different methods – from young kids to adults that are already working – to really exercise our own judgement. And that brings me to this AI for human empowerment. Can we build AI that is training us to become smarter, to become more able, more capable, more thoughtful, in addition to providing sources of information that are reliable and trustworthy?</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Garrett:</strong> So, empower people to be able to evaluate AI themselves?</p>
<p><strong>Mihaela van der Schaar:</strong> Yes, but not only AI – all information that is given to us.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Goodson:</strong> On misinformation, I think this is really an important topic, because large language models are extremely persuasive. I asked ChatGPT a puzzle question, and it calculated all of this stuff and gave me paragraphs of explanations, and the answer was [wrong]. But it was so convincing I was almost convinced that it was right. The problem is, these things have been trained on the internet and the internet is full of marketing – it’s trillions of words of extremely persuasive writing. So, these things are really persuasive, and when you put that into a political debate or an election campaign, that’s when it becomes really, really dangerous. And that is extremely worrying and needs to be regulated.</p>

<p>At the moment, if you type something into ChatGPT and you ask for references, half of them will be made up. We know that, and also OpenAI knows that. But it could be that, if there’s regulation that things are traceable, you should be able to ask, ‘How did this information come about? Where did it come from?’</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Mark Levene:</strong> You need ways to detect it. Even that is a big challenge. I don’t know if it’s impossible, because, if there’s regulation, for example, there should be traceability of data. So, at the moment, if you type something into ChatGPT and you ask for references, half of them will be made up. We know that, and also OpenAI knows that. But it could be that, if there’s regulation that things are traceable, you should be able to ask, “How did this information come about? Where did it come from?” But I agree that if you just look at an image or some text, and you don’t know where it came from, it’s easy to believe. Humans are easily fooled, because we’re just the product of what we know and what we’re used to, and if we see something that we recognise, we don’t question it.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-can-we-help-organisations-to-deploy-ai-in-a-responsible-way">How can we help organisations to deploy AI in a responsible way?</h3>
<p><strong>Detlef Nauck:</strong> Help for the industry to deploy AI reliably and responsibly is something that’s missing, and for that, trust in AI is one of the things that needs to be built up. And you can only build up trust in AI if you know what these things are doing and they’re properly documented and tested. So that’s the kind of infrastructure, if you like, that’s missing. It’s not all big foundation models. It’s about, how do you actually use this stuff in practice? And 90% of that will be small, purpose-built AI models. That’s an area where the government can help. How do you empower smaller companies that don’t have the background of how AI works and how it can be used, how can they be supported in knowing what they can buy and what they can use and how they can use it?</p>
<p><strong>Mark Levene:</strong> One example from healthcare which comes to mind: when you do a test, let’s say, a blood test, you don’t just get one number, you should get an interval, because there’s uncertainty. What current [AI] models do is they give you one answer, right? In fact, there’s a lot of uncertainty in the answer. One thing that can build trust is to make transparent the uncertainty that the AI outputs.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-can-data-scientists-and-statisticians-help-us-understand-how-to-use-ai-properly">How can data scientists and statisticians help us understand how to use AI properly?</h3>
<p><strong>Martin Goodson:</strong> One big thing, I think, is in culture. In machine learning – academic research and in industry – there isn’t a very scientific culture. There isn’t really an emphasis on observation and experimentation. We hire loads of people coming out of an MSc or a PhD in machine learning, and they don’t know anything, really, about doing an experiment or selection bias or how data can trip you up. All they think about is, you get a benchmark set of data and you measure the accuracy of your algorithm on that. And so there isn’t this culture of scientific experimentation and observation, which is what statistics is all about, really.</p>
<p><strong>Mihaela van der Schaar:</strong> I agree with you, this is where we are now. But we are trying to change it. As a matter of fact, at the next big AI conference, NeurIPS, we plan to do a tutorial to teach people exactly this and bring some of these problems to the forefront, because trying really to understand errors in data, biases, confounders, misrepresentation – this is the biggest problem AI has today. We shouldn’t just build yet another, let’s say, classifier. We should spend time to improve the ability of these machine learning models to deal with all sorts of data.</p>

<p><strong>Detlef Nauck:</strong> I think we all agree, another institute is not going to cut it. One of the main problems is regulators are not trained on AI, so it’s the wrong people looking into it. This is where some serious upskilling is required.</p>

<p><strong>Martin Goodson:</strong> If I was an AI, a superintelligent AI, the easiest path for me to cause the extinction of the human race would be to spread misinformation about climate change, right? So, let’s focus on misinformation, because that’s an immediate danger to our way of life. Why are we focusing on science fiction? Let’s focus on reality.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ai-tech-has-advanced-but-evaluation-metrics-havent-moved-forward.-why">AI tech has advanced, but evaluation metrics haven’t moved forward. Why?</h3>
<p><strong>Mihaela van der Schaar:</strong> First, the AI community that I’m part of innovates at a very fast pace, and they don’t reward metrics. I am a big fan of metrics, and I can tell you, I can publish much faster a method in these top conferences then I can publish a metric. Number two, we often have in AI very stupid benchmarks, where we test everything on one dataset, and these datasets may be very wrong. On a more positive note, this is an enormous opportunity for machine learners and statisticians to work together and advance this very important field of metrics, of test sets, of data generating processes.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Goodson:</strong> The big problem with metrics right now is contamination, because most of the academic metrics and benchmark sets that we’re talking about, they’re published on the internet, and these systems are trained on the internet. I’ve already said that I don’t think this [evaluation] institute should exist. But if it did exist, there’s one thing that they could do, which is important, and that would be to create benchmark datasets that they do not publish. But obviously, you may decide, also, that the traditional idea of having a training set and a test set just doesn’t make any sense anymore. And there are loads of issues with data contamination, and data leakage between the training sets and the test sets.</p>

<p><strong>Mark Levene:</strong> What’s important is to have an interdisciplinary team that will advise the government, rather than to build these institutes, and that this team should be independent and a team which will change over time, and it needs to be inclusive.</p>
<p><strong>Mihaela van der Schaar:</strong> AI safety is complex, and we need to realise that people need to have the right expertise to be able to really understand the risks. And there is risk, as I mentioned before, of potential collusion, where people are both building the AI and saying it’s safe, and we need to separate these two worlds.</p>
<p><strong>Detlef Nauck:</strong> Focus on the data, not the models. That’s what’s important to build AI.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>It was during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, when citizens in many countries around the world were confined to their homes, that Andrea Saltelli and colleagues were inspired to write “a manifesto for responsible modelling.” The television news was, Saltelli recalls, dominated by models of Covid infections, hospitalisations, and deaths. Politicians pointed to charts showing those model projections and spoke of “flattening the curve” – driving down case numbers – so as not to overwhelm healthcare systems.</p>
<p>While all this was going on, Saltelli came into contact “with a fantastic group of people,” he says, “all of whom were, in a sense, concerned by the sudden eruption of mathematical modelling into everyday life.”</p>
<p>“We were concerned that this [modelling] was not being done properly, that too much importance was given to those numbers, too much certainty was attached to them, and nobody seemed to realise that the selection of certain numbers rather than others would eventually and dramatically bias the message that was given.”</p>
<p>In June 2020, Saltelli – along with Monica Di Fiore, Deborah Mayo, Theodore Porter, Philip Stark and others – published in <em>Nature</em> their manifesto setting out “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01812-9">Five ways to ensure that models serve society</a>.” The ideas proposed in that three-page comment piece have now been given a book-length treatment, so we sat down with Saltelli to discuss <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-politics-of-modelling-9780198872412?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>The Politics of Modelling: Numbers Between Science and Policy</em></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Can you tell our readers a little about yourself?</strong><br>
I am a chemist. I got my degree in chemistry, but for most of my life I have worked as a mathematical modeller and applied statistician. More recently, let’s say in the last 10 years or so, I have also moved into issues of epistemology – meaning, how do we decide that we know what we know, and how do we do that when the source of the knowledge is represented by a mathematical model?</p>
<p><strong>I’d like to dig into the title of your new book. What should people understand about <em>The Politics of Modelling</em>?</strong><br>
It starts from a broader discussion of a state of exception enjoyed by mathematical modelling. One point we try to make in the book is that models are exceptional because they have an incredible palette of methodologies – even more than statistics. They are not a discipline, because everyone does modelling in their own craft in a different way. Modelling even escapes the gaze of sociologists most of the time because sociologists are more interested in algorithms and statistics. And, as a consequence of this state of exception, models enjoy many privileges, including a better defence of the pretence of neutrality, and they maintain, in a certain sense, a lapse of symmetry between developers and users. They also have a very strong grip on policy, whereby models can enjoy a high epistemic authority, and this epistemic authority seems to be proportional to the dimension of the model or the base of data on which the model has been calibrated. All of this creates a situation which leads to a problem – a problem for society, on the one hand, because models are used to suggest policies which are not optimal, and on the other hand, trust is consumed, trust is lost, and this may have been happening as a result of the Covid-19 epidemic and the way mathematical modelling was used in the context of the epidemic.</p>
<p><strong>The book emerged out of the “manifesto for responsible modelling” that you published in <em>Nature</em> a few years back. Could you describe that manifesto?</strong><br>
The manifesto was something which came out of the pandemic, in fact, because we were all locked up at home and we could spend some time reflecting and writing. We tried to produce a set of recommendations for both society and the modellers: for society to be a bit more circumspect in accepting results from mathematical modelling, and for modellers to be more cautious in formulating their predictions. But, beyond the issue of apparent precision of mathematical models, there was also the issue that models are built on a series of assumptions, each of which may have a great bearing on the result. And not only that but also, at the point where you formulate a mathematical model, you assume that you have already decided what is the problem, what is the direction of progress. So, there are really many normative assumptions which are embedded into that. Then there is the issue that mathematical models are not done by everyone; they are done by specific groups of people who belong to, normally, a certain identified class, some kind of elite – not a financial elite, but an elite in terms of competencies and knowledge. And this also creates bias, because – to put it brutally – if you can work at home with your laptop, the epidemic doesn’t affect you so much. But if you work in a plant and the plant is closed, and you are not paid, this destroys your life, or the life of your family. This asymmetry – or inequality, let’s say, or implicit bias – in those who are producing the analysis, this was, for many of us, an issue which needed to be brought to the attention of the public.</p>

<p>The manifesto was something which came out of the pandemic… We tried to produce a set of recommendations for both society and the modellers: for society to be a bit more circumspect in accepting results from mathematical modelling, and for modellers to be more cautious in formulating their predictions.</p>

<p><strong>Surely the urgency of the Covid situation prevented people from taking a step back and thinking more deeply about how models are constructed. Is it not forgivable in a situation like that? Or, is your argument that we should be doing this at all times, regardless of the urgency, regardless of the time pressures?</strong><br>
I am tempted to say both yes and no. Yes, because surely the situation was urgent, and many things which were done in a way which one would consider suboptimal were later justified on the grounds of urgency. We noted incredible differences in the measures adopted in several countries, so for us it was obvious that even though everyone was claiming to “follow the science,” they seemed to be following different sciences, or perhaps they were following “the science” which was more instrumental or more convenient to justify what was simply politically expedient.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I would say: it’s always urgent, no? We are very often in these kinds of situations. One might say that even the regulation of artificial intelligence today is urgent. Regulation of pesticides is urgent. Not to mention geopolitics… Everything seems to be urgent, and this seems to be a constant in our relationship with technology in particular: we don’t want to kill innovation, but if we wait to see what a new piece of technology does before we regulate it, then maybe it’s too late to change it. This is exploited by many people, not least [Mark] Zuckerberg [CEO of Facebook owner Meta]. He says, “Move fast and break things,” but once things are broken, they’re broken.</p>
<p>And talking about things being broken, what we discuss in the book is also this issue of broken trust. People are losing faith in expertise – not in all countries in the same way; there are national differences that are important. But, in general, if you measure trust in science – which is still very high – it’s taken quite a dent during the pandemic, and we argue that this was in part due to abuse of mathematical models.</p>
<p><strong>The book, which you’ve edited with Monica Di Fiore, breaks down the manifesto for responsible modelling into extended essays from different contributors, looking at different aspects of modelling – the framing of models, the assumptions, the consequences. For these essays, you draw on experts from different fields: sociology, philosophy, statistics, civil engineering, geography, law, environmental sciences, and others. Why was it important to get such diverse perspectives on these various aspects of modelling?</strong><br>
There is a major divide between social science – humanities – on the one hand and natural sciences on the other hand, with lots of suspicion between the two fields and sometimes open hostility. Mathematical modelling is particularly impenetrable, as we argue, to the gaze coming from a social scientist – at least, more impenetrable than statistics or algorithms, which have been very much studied in recent years. And so, it was important to allow the two fields, the two big communities, to communicate and to speak to one another in a critical way.</p>
<p><strong>You write in your introduction to the book that the field of statistics has spent more time thinking more deeply about questions of data ethics, model assumptions, and so on. Can you give an example?</strong><br>
There is a book by a group of French statisticians, <em>Statactivisme</em>, which is rich with examples of how a statistician could make a difference by simply producing better numbers. They don’t say, “Throw away the model, throw away the numbers,” but simply be careful of what numbers you use. And I think models and modellers need something like this, some kind of systematic debate – a societal debate – with other disciplines on what they’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>One of the quotes that jumped out at me from the book was, “Models are underexplained but overinterpreted.” How do we reset that balance?</strong><br>
This is more easily said than done. The remedies to this are, maybe we should spend some time thinking about reproducibility, even in mathematical modelling. This is not done. We talk about the reproducibility of data but very few people talk about the reproducibility of a mathematical model. Another thing which I think would be useful is to think more about how to interpret models and less about how to make them bigger. And then, of course, there is the practice of “assumption hunting.” If you use a model, go and hunt for the assumptions contributing to its construction.</p>
<p>To the modellers we say, engage yourself in something that might be called “modelling of the model process,” which means, try to imagine what would happen if you took a different branch in the construction of the model. In this we make an analogy to the “garden of the forking paths,” something that statisticians discuss, because they understand that when they build a statistical construction, they can take one way or another way, and when they measure the impact of taking a different path – as, for instance, when they give the same data to different teams – they find an amazing diversity of results that are totally unexpected. We are learning now that not only in statistics and mathematical modelling but in the laboratory, too – conducting physical experiments, not numerical ones – you can have a diverging set of outcomes depending on who is doing the analysis.</p>
<p>All this should call for a science that is more humble – one that accepts this kind of possibility and works actively to make these issues evident but also solves them in order to produce knowledge that is useful.</p>
<p><strong>Earlier, you spoke about modellers coming from a specific group or class of people – an elite. We interviewed, earlier this year, <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/interviews/posts/2023/01/25/erica-thompson.html">Erica Thompson</a>, author of the book <em>Escape from Model Land</em>, and one of the points Erica discussed was how to bring more diversity of thought and of voices into the modelling process. How do we engage broader communities in the construction of models – maybe not building the model itself, but thinking about what is important, what needs to be measured, what are we looking to understand?</strong><br>
This could be achieved if models were used in a context of what we, the authors, call an “extended peer community.” In other words, this is the idea that when you are discussing an issue, you should talk to the people directly affected by the issue because they have some knowledge about it. For this to take place, the model must be one instrument, which the community can get together to discuss, and so the model must not be too complex.</p>
<p><strong>Now that your book is out, what do you hope will be its impact?</strong><br>
Looking from the point of view of the modellers, I would like them to be more humble and less ambitious in developing monster models that are impossible to inspect and explore. From society I would like to see a more circumspect attitude, as I said before. Society has been trained to be sceptical of statistical information, but we should also be circumspect about the output of mathematical modelling. Ask more questions; ask, for instance, for the uncertainty range for a given number, or whether the number tells the entire story.</p>

  <title>Deduplicating and linking large datasets using Splink</title>
  <dc:creator>Robin Linacre</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In 2019, the data linking team at the Ministry of Justice was challenged to develop a new data linking methodology to produce new, higher quality linked datasets from the justice system.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal was to share new linked datasets with academic researchers, as part of the ADR UK-funded <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ministry-of-justice-data-first">Data First programme</a>. These datasets – which include data from prisons, probation, and the criminal and family courts – are now available, and researchers can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/moj-data-first-application-form-for-secure-access-to-data">apply for secure access</a>.</p>
<p>The linking methodology is widely applicable and has been published as a free and open source software package called <a href="https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink">Splink</a>. The software applies statistical best practice to accurately and quickly link and deduplicate large datasets. The software has now been downloaded over 7 million times, and has been used widely in government, academia and the private sector.</p>
<section id="the-problem" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>Data duplication is a ubiquitous problem affecting data quality. Organisations often have multiple records that refer to the same entity but no unique identifier that ties these entities together. Data entry errors and other issues mean that variations usually exist, so the records belonging to a single entity aren’t necessarily identical.</p>
<p>For example, in a company, customer data may have been entered multiple times in multiple different databases, with different spellings of names, different addresses, and other typos. The inability to identify which records belong to each customer presents a data quality problem at all stages of data analysis – from basic questions such as counting the number of unique customers, through to advanced statistical analysis.</p>
<p>With the growing size of datasets held by many organisations, any solution must be able to work on very large datasets of tens of millions of records or more.</p>
</section>
<section id="approach" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="approach">Approach</h2>
<p>In collaboration with academic experts, the team started with desk research into data linking theory and practice, and a review of existing open source software implementations.</p>
<p>One of the most common theoretical approaches described in the literature is the Fellegi-Sunter model. This statistical model has a long history of application for high profile, important record linking tasks such as in the US Census Bureau and the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS).</p>
<p>The model takes pairwise comparisons of records as an input, and outputs a match score between 0 and 1, which (loosely) can be interpreted as the probability of the two records being a match. Since the record comparison can be either two records from the same dataset, or records from different datasets, this is applicable to both deduplication and linkage problems.</p>
<p>An important benefit of the model is explainability. The model uses a number of parameters, each of which <a href="https://www.robinlinacre.com/partial_match_weights/">has an intuitive explanation</a> that can be understood by a non-technical audience. The relative simplicity of the model also means it is easier to understand and explain how biases in linkage may occur, such as varying levels of accuracy for different ethnic groups.</p>
<section id="example" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Consider the following simple record comparison. Are these records a match?</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://realworlddatascience.net/case-studies/posts/2023/11/22/images/record_comparison.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Colour coded comparison of two records.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The parameters of the model are known as partial match weights, which capture the strength of the evidence in favour or against these records being a match.</p>
<p>They can be represented in a chart as follows, in which the highlighted bars correspond to the above example record comparison:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://realworlddatascience.net/case-studies/posts/2023/11/22/images/partial_match_weights.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Chart showing partial match weights of model.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>We can see, for example, that the first name (Robin vs Robyn) is not an exact match, but they have a Jaro-Winkler similarity of above 0.9. As a result, the model ‘activates’ the corresponding partial match weight (in orange). This lends some evidence in favour of a match, but the partial match weight is not as strong as it would have been for an exact match.</p>
<p>Similarly we can see that the non-match on gender leads to the activation (in purple) of a strong negative partial match weight.</p>
<p>The activated partial match weight can then be represented in a waterfall chart as follows, which shows how the final match score is calculated:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://realworlddatascience.net/case-studies/posts/2023/11/22/images/waterfall.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption><strong>Figure 3</strong>: Waterfall chart showing how partial match weights combine to calculate the final prediction.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The parameter estimates in these charts all have intuitive explanations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The partial match weight on first name is positive, but relatively weak. This makes sense, because the first names are a fuzzy match, not an exact match, so this provides only moderate evidence in favour of the record being a match.</li>
<li>The match weight for the exact match on postcode is stronger than the equivalent weight for surname. This is because the cardinality of the postcode field in the underlying data is higher than the cardinality for surname, so matches on postcode are less likely to occur by chance than matches on surname.</li>
<li>The negative match weight for the mismatch on gender is relatively strong. This reflects the fact that, in this dataset, it’s uncommon for the ‘gender’ field to match amongst truly matching records.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final result is that the model predicts these records are a match, but with only 94% probability: it’s not sure. Most examples would be less ambiguous than this one, and would have a match probability very close to either 0 or 1.</p>
<p>For further details of the theory behind the Fellegi-Sunter model, and a deep dive into the intuitive explanations of the model, I have have developed a <a href="https://www.robinlinacre.com/intro_to_probabilistic_linkage/">series of interactive tutorials</a>.</p>

<section id="implementation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Through our desk research and open source software review, an existing software package called <a href="https://github.com/kosukeimai/fastLink">fastLink</a> was identified which implements the Fellegi-Sunter model, but unfortunately the software is not able to handle very large datasets of more than a few hundred thousand records.</p>
<p>Inspired by the popularity of fastLink, the team quickly realised that the methodology it was developing was generally applicable and could be valuable to a wide range of users if published as a software package.</p>
<p>As we spoke to colleagues across government and beyond, we found record linkage and deduplication problems are pervasive, and crop up in many different guises, meaning that any software needed to be very general and flexible.</p>
<p>The result is Splink – which is a Python package that implements the Fellegi-Sunter model, and enables parameters to be estimated using the Expectation Maximisation algorithm.</p>
<p>The package is free to use, <a href="https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink">and open source</a>. It is accompanied by <a href="https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/index.html">detailed documentation</a>, including a <a href="https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/demos/tutorials/00_Tutorial_Introduction.html">tutorial</a> and a set of <a href="https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/demos/examples/examples_index.html">examples</a>.</p>
<p>Splink makes no assumptions about the type of entity being linked, so it is very flexible. We are aware of its use to match data on a variety of entity types including persons, companies, financial transactions and court cases.</p>
<p>The package closely follows the statistical approach described in fastLink. In particular it implements the same mathematical model and likelihood functions described in the <a href="http://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/files/linkage.pdf">fastLink paper</a> (see pages 354 to 357), with a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure correctness of the implementation.</p>
<p>In addition, Splink introduces a number of innovations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Able to work at massive scale – with proven examples of its use on over 100 million records.</li>
<li>Extremely fast – capable of linking 1 million records on a laptop in around a minute.</li>
<li><a href="https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/charts/index.html">Comprehensive graphical output</a> showing parameter estimates and iteration history make it easier to understand the model and diagnose statistical issues.</li>
<li><a href="https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/charts/waterfall_chart.html">A waterfall chart</a> which can be generated for any record pair, which explains how the estimated match probability is derived.</li>
<li>Support for deduplication, linking, and a combination of both, including support for deduplicating and linking multiple datasets.</li>
<li>Greater customisability of record comparisons, including the ability <a href="https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/topic_guides/comparisons/customising_comparisons.html">to specify custom, user defined comparison functions.</a></li>
<li>Term frequency adjustments on any number of columns.</li>
<li>It’s possible to save a model once it’s been estimated – enabling a model to be estimated, quality assured, and then reused as new data becomes available.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/">companion website</a> provides a complete description of the various configuration options, and examples of how to achieve different linking objectives.</li>

<p>The example shows the flexibility of Splink, and how various types of configuration can be used:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How should different data fields be compared?</strong> In this example, the Jaro-Winkler distance is used for names, whereas Levenshtein is used for date of birth since Jaro-Winkler is not appropriate for numeric data.</li>
<li><strong>What blocking rules should be used?</strong> Blocking rules are the primary determinants of how fast Splink will run, but there is a trade off between speed and accuracy. In this case, the input data is small, so the blocking rules are loose.</li>
<li><strong>How should the model parameters be estimated?</strong> In this case, the user has no labels for supervised training, and so uses the unsupervised Expectation Maximisation approach.</li>
<li><strong>Is clustering needed?</strong> In this case, each person may potentially have many duplicates, so clustering is used. This creates an estimated (synthetic) unique identifier for each entity (person) in the input dataset.</li>
</ul>

<p>Incarcerated youth are an exceptionally vulnerable population, and body-worn cameras are an important tool of accountability both for those incarcerated and the staff who supervise them. In 2018 the Texas Juvenile Justice Department (TJJD) deployed body-worn cameras for the first time, and this is a case study of how the agency developed a methodology for measuring the success of the camera rollout. This is also a case study of analysis failure, as it became clear that real-world implementation problems were corrupting the data and rendering the methodology unusable. However, the process of working through the causes of this failure helped the agency identify previously unrecognized problems and ultimately proved to be of great benefit. The purpose of this case study is to demonstrate how negative findings can still be incredibly useful in real-world settings.</p>

<p>Body-worn cameras became a standard tool of policing in the US in the mid-2010s. By recording officer interactions with the public, law enforcement agencies could achieve a greater degree of accountability. Not only could credible claims of police abuse against civilians be easily verified, the argument went, but false accusations would decline as well, saving law enforcement agencies time and resources that would otherwise be wasted on spurious allegations. Initial studies seemed to support this argument.</p>
<p>TJJD faced similar issues to law enforcement agencies, and body-worn cameras seemed like they could be a useful tool. Secure youth residential facilities in Texas all had overhead cameras, but these were very old (they still ran on tape) and captured no audio. This presented a number of problems when it came to deciphering contested incidents, not to mention that these cameras had clearly not prevented any of the agency’s prior scandals from taking place. TJJD received special funding from the legislature to roll out body-worn cameras system-wide, and all juvenile correctional officers were required to wear one.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<section id="background" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background">Background</h2>
<p>From the outset of the rollout of body-worn cameras, TJJD faced a major issue with implementation: in 2019, body worn cameras were an established tool for law enforcement, but there was very little literature or best practice to draw from for their use in a correctional environment. Unlike police officers, juvenile correctional officers (JCOs) deal directly with their charges for virtually their entire shift. In an eight-hour shift, a police officer might record a few calls and traffic stops. A juvenile correctional officer, on the other hand, would record for almost eight consecutive hours. And, because TJJD recorded round-the-clock for hundreds of employees at a time, this added up very quickly to <em>a lot</em> of footage.</p>
<p>For example, a typical dorm in a correctional center might have four JCOs assigned to it. Across a single week, these four JCOs would be expected to record at least 160 hours of footage.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<div class="figure-caption" style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Four JCOs x 40 hours per week = 160 hours of footage.</p>
</div>
<p>This was replicated across every dorm. Three dorms, for example, would produce nearly 500 hours of footage, as seen below.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</figure>
</div>
<div class="figure-caption" style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Three dorms x four JCOs x 40 hours per week = 480 hours of footage.</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, we had more than one facility. Four facilities with three dorms each would produce nearly 2,000 hours of footage every week.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</figure>
</div>
<div class="figure-caption" style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Four facilities x three dorms x four JCOs x 40 hours per week = 1,960 hours of footage.</p>
</div>
<p>In actuality, we had a total of five facilities each with over a dozen dorms producing an anticipated <strong>17,000 hours</strong> of footage every week – an impossible amount to monitor manually.</p>
<p>As a result, footage review had to be done in a limited, reactive manner. If our monitoring team received an incident report, they could easily zero in on the cameras of the officers involved and review the incident accordingly. But our executive team had hoped to be able to use the footage proactively, looking for “red flags” in order to <em>prevent</em> potential abuses instead of only responding to allegations.</p>
<p>Because the agency had no way of automating the monitoring of footage, any proactive analysis had to be metadata-based. But what to look for in the metadata? Once again, the lack of best-practice literature left us in the lurch. So, we brainstormed ideas for “red flags” and came up with the following that could be screened for using camera metadata:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Minimal quantity of footage</strong> – our camera policy required correctional officers to have their cameras on at all times in the presence of youth. No footage meant they weren’t using their cameras.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Frequently turning the camera on and off</strong> – a correctional officer working a dorm should have their cameras always on when around youth and not be turning them on and off repeatedly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Large gaps between clips</strong> – it defeats the purpose of having cameras if they’re not turned on.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, we came up with a fourth red flag, which could be screened for by comparing camera metadata with shift-tracking metadata:</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><strong>Mismatch between clips recorded and shifts worked</strong> – the agency had very recently rolled out a new shift tracking software. We should expect to see the hours logged by the body cameras roughly match the shift hours worked.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis-part-1-quality-control-and-footage-analysis">Analysis, part 1: Quality control and footage analysis</h2>
<p>For this analysis, I gathered the most recent three weeks of body-worn camera data – which, at the time, covered April 1–21, 2019. I also pulled data from Shifthound (our shift management software) covering the same time period. Finally, I gathered HR data from CAPPS, the system that most of the State of Texas used at the time for personnel management and finance.<sup>1</sup> I then performed some quality control work, summarized in the dropdown box below.</p>

<p><code>SkimR</code> is a helpful <code>R</code> package for exploratory analysis that gives summary statistics for every variable in a data frame, including missing values. After using the <code>skim</code> function on clip data, shift data, and HR data, I noticed that the clip data had some missing values for employee ID. This was an error which pointed to data entry mistakes – body-worn cameras do not record footage on their own, after all, so employee IDs should be assigned to each clip.</p>
<p>From here I compared the employee ID field in the clip data to the employee ID field in the HR data. Somewhat surprisingly, IDs existed in the clip data that did not correspond to any entries in the HR data, indicating yet more data entry mistakes – the HR data is the ground truth for all employee IDs. I checked the shift data for the same error – employee IDs that did not exist in the HR data – and found the same problem.</p>
<p>As well as employee IDs that did not exist in the HR data, I also looked for employee IDs in the footage and shift data which related to staff who were not actually employed between April 1–21, 2019. I found some examples of this, which indicated yet more errors: staff cannot use a body-worn camera or log a shift if they have yet to begin working or if they have been terminated (system permissions are revoked upon leaving employment).</p>
<p>I made a list of every erroneous ID to pass off to HR and monitoring staff before excluding them from the subsequent analysis. In total, 10.6% of clips representing 11.3% of total footage had to be excluded due to these initial data quality issues, foreshadowing the subsequent data quality issues the analysis would uncover.</p>
<p>The full analysis script <a href="https://t.ly/BUNRZ">can be found on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>In order to operationalize the “red flags” from our brainstorming session, I needed to see what exactly the cameras captured in their metadata. The variables most relevant to our purposes were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clip start</li>
<li>Clip end</li>
<li>Camera used</li>
<li>Who was assigned to the camera at the time</li>
<li>The role of the person assigned to the camera</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these fields, I first created the following <strong>aggregations per employee ID</strong>:</p>

<p>Once I established these metrics for each employee I looked at their respective distributions. Standard staff shift lengths at the time were eight hours. If staff were using their cameras appropriately, we would expect to see distributions centered around clip lengths of about an hour, eight or fewer clips per day, and 8-12 footage hours per day. We would also expect to see 0 large gaps.</p>

</div>
<p>By eyeballing the distributions I could tell most staff were recording fewer than 10 clips per day, shooting about 0.5–2 hours for each clip, for a total of 2–10 hours of daily footage, with the majority of employees having less than one significant gap per day. Superficially, this appeared to provide evidence of widespread attempts at complying with the body-worn camera policy and no systemic rejection or resistance. If this were indeed the case, then we could turn our attention to individual outliers.</p>
<p>First, though, we thought we would attempt to validate this initial impression by testing another assumption. If each employee works on average 40 hours per week – a substantial underestimate given how common overtime was – we should expect, over a three-week period, to see about 120 hours of footage per employee in the dataset. This is <em>not</em> what we found.</p>
<p>Average footage per employee was 70.2 hours over the three-week period, meaning that the average employee was recording less than 60% of shift hours worked. With so many hours going unrecorded for unknown reasons, we needed to investigate further.</p>
<p>Surely the shift data would clarify this…</p>

<p>With the data on shifts worked from our timekeeping system, I could theoretically compare actual shifts worked to the amount of footage recorded. If there were patterns in where the gaps in footage fell, that comparison might help to explain why.</p>
<p>In order to join the shift data to the camera data, I needed a common unit of analysis beyond “Employee ID.” Using only this value would produce a nonsensical table that joined up every clip of footage to every shift worked.</p>
<p>For example, let’s take employee #9001005 at Facility Epsilon between April 1–3. This employee has the following clips recorded during that time period:</p>

<p>The table shows two eight-hour morning shifts from 6:00 am to 2:00 pm. We can join the two tables together by ID on a messy many-to-many join, but that tells us nothing about how much they overlap (or fail to overlap) without extensive additional work. For example, we have a unique identifier for employee clip (Clip_ID) and employee shift (Shift_ID), but what we need is a unique identifier that can be used to join the two. Fortunately, for this particular data we can <em>create</em> a unique identifier since both clips and shifts are fundamentally measures of <em>time</em>. While Employee_ID is not in itself unique (i.e., one employee can have multiple clips attached to that ID), Employee_ID combined with time of day is unique. A person can only be in one place at a time, after all!</p>
<p>To reshape the data for joining, I created a function that takes any data frame with a start and end column and unfolds it into discrete units of time. Using the code below to create the “Interval_Convert” function, the shift data above for employee 9001005 converts into one entry per hour of the day per shift. As a result, two eight-hour shifts get turned into 16 employee hours (a sample of which is shown below).</p>

<p>The footage could be converted in a similar manner, and in this way I could break down both the shift data and the clip data into an hour-by-hour view and compare them to one another. Using this new format, I joined together the full tables of footage and shifts to determine how much footage was recorded with no corresponding shift in the timekeeping system.</p>

<p>Oh dear. Again, almost every employee has logged shift hours with no footage: 47,000 hours in total. To put it another way, that’s an entire work week per employee not showing up in camera footage.</p>
<p>At this point, we could probably rule out deliberate noncompliance. The clip data already implied that most employees were following the policy, and our facility leadership would surely have noticed a mass refusal large enough to show up this clearly in the data.</p>
<p>One way to check for deliberate noncompliance would be to first exclude shifts that contain zero footage whatsoever. This would rule out total mismatches, where – for whatever reason – the logged shifts had totally failed to overlap with recorded clips. For the remaining shifts that <em>do</em> contain footage, we could look at the proportion of the shift covered by footage. So, if an eight-hour shift had four hours of recorded footage associated with it, then we could say that 50% of the shift had been recorded. The following histogram is a distribution of the number of employees organized by the percent of their shift-hours they recorded (but only shifts that had a nonzero amount of footage).</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>As it turned out, most employees recorded the majority of their matching shifts, a finding that roughly aligns with the initial clip analysis. So, what explains the 14,000 hours of footage with no shifts, and the 47,000 hours of shifts with no footage?</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="causes-of-failure">Causes of failure</h2>
<p>Here, I believed, we had reached the end of what I could do with data alone, and so I presented these findings (or lack thereof) to executive leadership. The failure to gather reliable data from linking the clip data to the shift data prompted follow-ups into what exactly was going wrong. As it turned out, <em>many</em> things were going wrong.</p>
<p>First, a number of technical problems plagued the early rollout of the cameras:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All of our facilities suffered from high turnover, and camera ownership was not consistently updated. Employees who no longer worked at the agency could therefore appear in the clip data – somebody else had taken over their camera but had not put their name and ID on it.</p></li>
<li><p>We had no way of telling if a camera was not recording due to being docked and recharging or not recording due to being switched off.</p></li>
<li><p>In the early days of the rollout, footage got assigned to an employee based on the owner of the <em>dock</em>, not the camera. In other words, if Employee A had recorded their shift with their camera but uploaded the footage using a dock assigned to Employee B then the footage would show up in the system as belonging to Employee B.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The shift data was, unsurprisingly, even worse, and it was here we came across our most important finding. While the evidence showed that there wasn’t any widespread non-compliance with the use of the cameras, there <em>was</em> widespread non-compliance with the use of our shift management software. Details are included in the dropdown box below.</p>

<p>Our HR system, CAPPS, had a feature that tracked hours worked in order to calculate leave and overtime pay. However, CAPPS was a statewide application designed for 9–5 office workers, and could not capture the irregular working hours of our staff (much less aid in planning future shifts). We had obtained separate shift management software to fill these gaps, but not realized how inconsistently it was being used. All facilities were required to have their employees log their shifts, but some followed through on this better than others. And even for those that did make a good-faith effort at follow-through, quality control was nonexistent.</p>
<p>In CAPPS, time entry determined pay, so strong incentives existed to ensure accurate entry. But for our shift management software, no incentives existed at all for making sure that entries were correct. For example, a correctional officer could have a 40-hour work week scheduled in the shift software but miss the entire week due to an injury, and the software would still show them as having worked 40 hours that week. Nobody bothered to go back and correct these types of errors because there was no reason to.</p>
<p>The software was intended to be used proactively for planning purposes, not after-the-fact for logging and tracking purposes. Thus, it produced data that was totally inconsistent with actual hours worked, which became apparent when compared to data (like body-worn camera footage) that tracked actual hours on the floor.</p>
<p>In the end, we had to rethink a number of aspects of the shift software’s implementation. In the process of these fixes, leadership also came to make explicit that the software’s primary purpose was to help facilities schedule future shifts, not audit hours worked after the fact (which CAPPS already did, just on a day-by-day basis as opposed to an hour-by-hour basis). This analysis was the only time we attempted to use the shift data in this manner.</p>

<p>Whatever means we used to monitor compliance with the camera policy, we learned that it couldn’t be fully automated. The agency followed up this analysis with a random sampling approach, in which monitors would randomly select times of day they knew a given staff member would have to have their cameras turned on and actually watch the associated clips. This review process confirmed the first impressions from the statistical review above: most employees <em>were</em> making good faith attempts at complying with the policy despite technical glitches, short-staffing, and administrative confusion. It also confirmed that proactive monitoring of correctional officers was a human process which had to come from supervisors and staff.</p>
<p>The one piece of the analysis we did use going forward was the clip analysis (converted into a Power BI dashboard and included in the <a href="https://github.com/enndubbs/Body-Worn-Camera-Monitoring">GitHub repository</a> for this article), but only as a supplement for already-launched investigations, not a prompt for one. Body-worn camera footage remained immensely useful for investigations after-the-fact, but inconsistencies in clip data were not, in and of themselves, particularly noteworthy “red flags.” At the end of the day, analytics can contextualize and enhance human judgment, but it cannot replace it.</p>
<p>In academia, the bias in favor of positive findings is well-documented. The failure to find something, or a lack of statistical significance, does not lend itself to publication in the same way that a novel discovery does. But, in an applied setting, where results matter more than publication criteria, negative findings can be highly insightful. They can falsify erroneous assumptions, bring unknown problems to light, and prompt the creation of new processes and tools. In this context, a failure is only truly a failure if nothing is learned from it.</p>
